# Welcome to Venipedia!

This wiki is made possible through [git-wiki-theme](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-theme) and its [skeleton](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-skeleton) template. This project is headed primarily by [Hemlock of Belladonna](Char.Hemlock%20of%20Belladonna), though occasional remarks from assistant [Ishy](Char.Ishy%20the%20Fuecoco) or other members of the Guild may be added in as well.

If you're interested in helping this project, feel free to! [We are open-source](https://github.com/Nidoskull/Hemlore) and welcome any contributions!
## Goals
The goal of Venipedia is to be an easily-understandable, but very comprehensive compendium on everything that the [Glaive Expedition Federation](Guild.Glaive%20Expedition%20Federation) has encountered! From happenings here in [Satojiri](Region.Satojiri) to ancient myths from [Hisinoh](Region.Hisinoh), anything I can make an excuse for to be on this resource will have a place here.
If you find a page to be lacking in information, please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Nidoskull/issues) so I don't lose track of it.

#### Categories/Tags
The following things are on every page; they have no bearing on the actual wiki, but they make the Obsidian Vault look pretty.
