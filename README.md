# Welcome to Venipedia!

This wiki is made possible through [git-wiki-theme](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-theme) and its [skeleton](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-skeleton) template. This project is headed primarily by [Hemlock the Venipede](Hemlock%20the%20Venipede.md), though occasional remarks from assistant [Ishy](wiki/Ishy%20the%20Fuecoco) or other members of the Guild may be added in as well.

If you're interested in helping this project, feel free to! [We are open-source](https://github.com/Nidoskull/Hemlore) and welcome any contributions!
## Goals
The goal of Venipedia is to be an easily-understandable, but very comprehensive compendium on everything that the [Glaive Expedition Federation](wiki/Glaive%20Expedition%20Federation.md) has encountered! From happenings here in [Satojiri](wiki/Satojiri) to ancient myths from [Hisinoh](wiki/Hisinoh), anything I can make an excuse for to be on this resource will have a place here.
If you find a page to be lacking in information, please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Nidoskull/issues) so I don't lose track of it.
