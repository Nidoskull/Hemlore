# Welcome to Venipedia!

This wiki is made possible through [git-wiki-theme](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-theme) and its [skeleton](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-skeleton) template. This project is headed primarily by [[Hemlock-the-Venipede|Hemlock the Venipede]], though occasional remarks from assistant [[Ishy the Fuecoco|Ishy]] or other members of the Guild may be added in as well.

If you're interested in helping this project, feel free to! [We are open-source](https://github.com/Nidoskull/Hemlore) and welcome any contributions!

This is a ping test.

## Goals
The goal of Venipedia is to be an easily-understandable, but very comprehensive compendium on everything that the [[Glaive Expedition Federation]] has encountered! From happenings here in [[Satojiri]] to ancient myths from [[Hisinoh]], anything I can make an excuse for to be on this resource will have a place here.
If you find a page to be lacking in information, please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Nidoskull/Hemlore/issues) so I don't lose track of it.
