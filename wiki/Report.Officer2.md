Dura Town plans discussion. Each officer will express a Big Want, something they want to see prioritized.

Dusknoir votes for a Bank. Celebi alleges Dusknoir ran a bank in Treasure City but he does not remember this nor is he still certified.
Volcarona votes for a place of worship. She could train a priesthood to serve there. Not top priority, though.
Machoke wants beefed up roads.
Swellow wants the dock to be repaired. River deliveries are currently limited by Carracosta's cargo loading and unloading abilities.
Hemlock seconds the vote for a Bank.
Baxcalibur wants a mausoleum. He notes that this could be folded into Volcarona's worship place.
Darmanitan (absent) wants an Isshu-style self-service shop kiosk.

In order, BANK, Dock, Roads, Self-Service Kiosks, Worship place, mausoleum.
