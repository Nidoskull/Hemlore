# Tera Crystal
A **Tera Crystal** is a source of [Terastal](Terastalization) Energy. Being near one allows one to more easily tap into Terastalization, changing one's type entirely.

Tera Crystals are most commonly seen in [Cabodea](Region.Cabodea) and [Korakita](Region.Korakita), though every continent has at least a few.

In [Satojiri](Region.Satojiri), Tera Crystals are notably rare; during the rule of the [Queen of Shattered Crystals](Char.Queen%20of%20Shattered%20Crystals), nearly all were shattered due to said Queen's jealousy. Due to this, only six Crystals remain in the region, and five of them have their locations heavily guarded. The most recently planted Tera Crystal is in [Dura Town](City.Dura%20Town).
