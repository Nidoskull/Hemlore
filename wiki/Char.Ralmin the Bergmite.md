## Description
**Ralmin** the **[Bergmite](Species.Bergmite)** is a rookie explorer that founded [Team Stamp Squad](Team.Stamp%20Squad). He is 15 years old and from an unknown [Flow](Species.Bergmite), likely from the [Polar Sea](Loc.Polar%20Sea). They use he/they pronouns.

Ralmin wears their team bandana around his waist, making him look a little like sushi. They have white stripes in their ice, and his iceberg is shaped almost like a [Basculegion's](Species.Basculin) jaw. He often seems nervous. Ralmin has notably terrible charisma.

Ralmin speaks [Satojiran](Region.Satojiri) and is attempting to learn [Ancestral Ice](Mech.Type).

## Relationships
Unfortunately, Ralmin does not remember any of their family. They're actively trying to find out where they came from, though.

They were quite close with [Epinephrine the Dottler](Char.Epinephrine%20the%20Dottler) (or Eppie) before Epinephrine moved away for their studies.

As founding member of Team Stamp Squad, he's close with [Titania the Tinkatink](Char.Titania%20the%20Tinkatink), [Kasi the Ralts](Char.Kasi%20the%20Ralts), and [Razor the Gible](Char.Razor%20the%20Gible).

## History
Ralmin remembers very, *very* little about his life before waking up near a big city. He loosely remembers hearing some kind of voice cheering him on shortly before he actually woke up, but doesn't know who or where or what that voice could be.

Shortly after waking up, he encountered Epinephrine who snuck them into their school as a roommate. The two grew close, but Eppie eventually had to leave Satojiri for higher education. Ralmin learned of the [Glaive Expedition Federation](Guild.Glaive) through Epinephrine, and decided to apply to obtain a goal in life beyond simply drifting as icebergs tend to do.
