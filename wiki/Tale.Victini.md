# Lady Victini

## Description
Victini, rest her soul, is a Mythical Pokemon. She is considered a deity of Luck and is responsible for [Shiny](Mech.Shiny) Pokemons. She's also known as "The star lady in charge"

She has never been seen physically by the cast, nor seen in depictions. She is probably _The_ Narrator (or at least the narrator when [Neon](Char.Neon the Eelektrik) is present)

## Relationships
It's said Victini was supposed to marry a [Masked Lady](Tale.Ogerpon) one night, before she was assassinated.

She's also able to communicate telephatically with any shiny pokemon, like [Neon](Char.Neon the Eelektrik)

## History
Victini crash landed on earth eons ago, during the age fossil pokemons still roamed the land, killing most of them instantly. Afterward, she granted [Relicanth](Char.Relicanth (Glaive)) and her late husband Anorith a special daughter, being the first shiny Pokemon.

Around 6000 years ago, during [Nova's Time Travel Episode](Report.Nova3), she helped Neon and [Ladon](Char.Ladon the Dipplin) reanimate the late Basillina Matidia.

At an unknown date, she was murdered in [Casa Victoria](City.Casa Victoria) on her wedding night supposedly by the Loyal Three.

During Joint Expedition 5, she grants her blessing to [Zygarde](Tale.Zygarde) after They absorbed Neon to get into Their 50% form. During this, both deities combined their powers to violate the natural order of things and force Neon to evolve, else it would have been absorbed permanently
