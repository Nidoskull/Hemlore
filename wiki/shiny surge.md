## Shiny Surge

Shiny Surge is a special ability specific to Shiny Pokemon, granted by [Victini](Victini), allowing them to do a special action during a battle in dungeon.

These actions can vary from getting a super-effective move in a pinch, to surviving a KO; and can be used in tandem with another's shiny surge for a much greater effect. If used to avoid fainting, the user only gets half the xp after battle.
