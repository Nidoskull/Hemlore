# Mestor Wormwood, father of Libanos
`Paste icon here`
## Description
**Wormwood** the **[Trevenant](Species.Phantump)** holds the title of Mestor in [Carew City](City.Carew%20City). First encountered during [Nova mission 3](Report.Nova3), he is at minimum six-thousand years old. They have presumably also been known as Phantump.

Unlike a typical Trevenant, Wormwood's wood is almost fungal, with a dark blue tint and with slightly glowing brighter blue cracks in the bark. Though he still appears to have proper leaves, they are an unnatural shade of blue. His ghostly parts are blue as well. 

He speaks [Satojiran](Region.Satojiri).

## Relationships
Known relatives are:
- [Betula](Char.Betula%20the%20Trevenant) (Wife)
- [Libanos](Char.Libanos%20the%20Phantump) (Daughter)
- [Ladon](Char.Ladon%20the%20Dipplin) (Son-in-law)

It is unknown which of Wormwood's revolutionaries made it to the current age. However, six thousand years ago, he worked with [Team Nova](Team.Nova), [Despina](Char.Despina%20the%20Heracross), [Kostas](Char.Kostas%20the%20Pinsir), Skarmory, and the not-yet-part-of-Nova Aemilia to depose the false Basileus, Fictusilva. Additionally, he is coworkers with [Strategos Brutus](Char.Strategos%20Brutus).
