`Paste icon here`
## Description
**[Blaziken](Species.Torchic)** holds the title of Guildmaster in [Wigglytuff's Guild](Wigglytuff%27s%20Guild). He has, presumably, also been known as Combusken and Torchic. He uses he/him pronouns.

Blaziken has been titled Exploratores Temporis-Tenebrarum by [Princeps Maris Caeli-Explorator](Princeps%20Maris%20Caeli-Explorator). He's thirty years old.

Blaziken speaks fluent [Satojiran](Region.Satojiri), and may speak other languages.

## Relationships
Blaziken is part of [Team Aquaflame](Team.Aquaflame) alongside [Feraligatr](Char.Feraligatr%20(Team%20Aquaflame)).

He appears to be chill with [Darkrai](Tale.Darkrai).

He's actually pen-pals with [me](Char.Hemlock%20of%20Belladonna)! :)
## History
According to [Dusknoir](Char.Dusknoir%20(Glaive)), Blaziken was once from [another world where Pokémon are not all there is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth). In another shape, he met Treecko, as first partner. This *may* be the very same Treecko that eventually evolved into [Sceptile](Char.Sceptile%20(Wigglytuff%27s)). (citation needed)

I sadly lack more knowledge... but it is evident that *something* happened, and Blaziken was transformed in some manner or another.

Now a Torchic, he met with then-[Totodile](Char.Feraligatr%20(Team%20Aquaflame)) on the beach near [Treasure City](City.Treasure%20City), and formed [Team Aquaflame](Team.Aquaflame) together.

It is unknown exactly how, but Blaziken and Feraligatr have played a crucial role in [restarting the flow of time](Tale.Time%20Stopped).
