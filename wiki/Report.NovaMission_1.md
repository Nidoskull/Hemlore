# Mission Report: Team Nova #001
**Dungeon**: [Sunlit Meadows]()

**Members**: [Team_Nova](Team_Nova): [Hemlock](Hemlock_the_Venipede) (level 5), [Neon](Neon_the_Tynamo) (level 6), [Gambit](Gambit_the_Pawniard) (level 5)

**Missions**: Item retrieval - Spoink's orb

---
As the sun rains down on our trio of intrepid heroes, the faint sound of buzzing Combee and galloping Skiddo disrupts the silence of the Sunlit Meadows.

The team finds ghost [Shard Box]() then Neon gets in a fight alone until the others come to help. Neon almost dies to a single Bellsprout.
On the 3rd floor the terrain becomes grassy, then we find a strange rock with something possibly inside; and even laterer we find Spoink's orb

[Monster house](). Hemlock gets KO'd and then not and then escapes the floor while Neon and Gambit stay and fight the remaining pokemons.

On the last floor of the dungeon we find a Ditto that rewards us with a move from a line's parent. Gambit takes up Sucker Punch.

We finish the dungeon and warp to the guild.
