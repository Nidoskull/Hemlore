Entering the Dungeon, Hemlock is immediately distracted by carvings on the wall. Hemlock enrages a group of Pokémon and swiftly gets KO'd. Instead of taking the stairs like sensible mons, the team collectively decides to jump down a random hole after Gambit does it first.

Landing in a Tera-Electric Nosepass's home, the group manages to ignore the singing long enough to not get annihilated by the Nosepass, and instead manage to talk it down before it tump-tump-tumps away.

Investigating the singing, the Team finds a statue of a [Zarude](Basileus%20Zarude). Poking even closer, suddenly...! The walls of the ruins around Team Nova reassemble themselves. Roots recede, crumbled reliefs recompose themselves. Dust becomes bone, bone becomes flesh, flesh springs back to life. Team Nova has found themselves in [Carew City](Carew%20City)... without Razor.

The tune they hear becomes notes on an ocarina, ever-so-slightly different. Looking back at the statue of Zarude, it's brand-new, freshly-painted. Hemlock accidentally causes a scene simply by existing, and a guard is brought over to inform the Team that all newcomers to the city must visit the [Basileus](Basileus%20Fictusilva).

The Basileus appears shocked that these children have names. In Carew City, you must either arrive with a name, or marry or bear children within the city's walls to earn one. When pressured as to _how_ the team arrived to Carew, Hemlock begins to answer, only to be interrupted by [Aemilia the Rookidee](Aemilia%20the%20Rookidee), informing the Basileus and also Team Nova that Team Nova came in with the traveling carts, unconscious.

[Mestor Wormwood](Mestor%20Wormwood) offers to house Team Nova for the night, curious to learn more about these travellers. His wife, [Betula](Betula%20the%20Trevenant), speaks of their child, [Phantump](Libanos%20the%20Phantump) while she prepares dinner. Hemlock wows the Trevenants by offering them some Honey in return for their food. Team Nova gradually puzzles together that they've travelled through time; the only question now is by how much, so Hemlock asks for the date.

As it turns out, they have travelled six thousand years into the past. They have landed on the ninth day of Palkuary in 832 ISC. 

Being unable to hide their surprise at this information, Mestor Wormwood asks a very pointed question; from *when* did these children come? Wormwood asks Team Nova to listen to a now-widely-known story about [one of Isshu's founding rulers](Emboar%20(Isshuan%20Founder)). A good story. A good king. Then, he asks one more question. Does Team Nova believe all kings are good?

Hemlock answers that kings are still Pokémon. Gambit agrees, and shares that many parts of modern Isshu consider no king a better situation than a bad king.

Mestor Wormwood requests that Team Nova aids him in overthrowing the [pretender on the throne](Basileus%20Fictusilva) and restoring the rightful dynasty. After some deliberation, mostly about whether this would count as murder or not, Team Nova agrees to rescue the [Sebaste](Basilinna%20Matidia) at minimum, and see what they could do to overthrow the Basileus.

As Mestor Wormwood calls in his co-conspirators, the plans are laid out. In the Basileus's storerooms are ancient weapons, [stones of crystallized blood](Mega%20Stones). Unfortunately, the storerooms are strange and enchanted in a way that makes them never the same. Almost dungeon-esque. Fortunately, dungeons are Team Nova's specialty. Aemilia offers to join them.

Before the revolutionaries move, Phantump comes forward. She and her partner, [Applin](Ladon%20the%20Dipplin), wish to have their names in case things go awry, and they are forgotten by the [Blue Antlers of Life](Xerneas%20(Myth)). Lacking a proper minister, Neon is called to officiate the wedding, as one who is touched by a legend. Applin is named Ladon by his wife, and Ladon names her Libanos in turn.

Moving swiftly, Team Nova and Aemilia move towards breaking into the storerooms, dodging Carnivine guards. Using a charge of its Shiny Surge, Neon learns Flamethrower to deal with a Carnivine that spotted us; combined with Hemlock's Twineedle and Gambit's Fury Cutter, the guard is dispatched before it's a problem. Aemilia snatches a strange smiling golden idol and tosses it into Hemlock's bag, which activates a rolling boulder trap. Hemlock is seperated from the rest.

Hemlock escapes into a room to the south, the boulder knocking out the five guards in said room. Taking the chance to loot the storerooms, Hemlock finds an Odd Stone that looks rather like a Mega Stone. Turning to the east, it reconvenes with its team. 

Team Nova and Aemilia find a pink crystal, later identified as a Fairium Z crystal. Going down the stairs, they run into three guards which spot them. Failing to lie their way out of a fight, Gambit pulls out a Plane Seed, which throws one of the guards into the Doom Dimension. The other guards run away terrified.

Team Nova and Aemilia locate their prize; a box of five Mega Stones. Pinsirite, Venusaurite, Heracronite, Beedrillite, and Dragonitite Z. In the process of grabbing an Escape Orb, the Mega Stone Box gets wibbled, and the Beedrillite rolls through a crack in the wall, lost forever.

Over in the present, Razor am steppies. Razor is looking for Team Nova, but instead runs into a Beedrill, with a pretty rock that looks like it. A wish comes true, and the bee becomes bigger. Razor, too, decides to be bigger, pulling out a purple rock glowing with red energy.

Escape Orbs are calibrated geographically. They do not inherently have time travel abilities.
