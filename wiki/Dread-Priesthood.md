# Dread Priesthood
The **Dread Priesthood** is a religious group, possibly a cult, focused on spreading fear and confusion outside of their group. They were first encountered by one of our teams in [Gummy Mission Report #004](Report.GummyMission-4.md).

The average laymon has a highly negative opinion of this group due to aforementioned goals of spreading fear and uproar. 

They are, allegedly, an ancient order that dates back to not long after the original Fell Beasts were defeated. Not much has been seen of the Dread Priesthood in recent years after Rescue Heads [Vulcan](Rescue-Head-Vulcan) and [Sakura](Rescue-Head-Sakura) went on a mission to rescue victims intended to be used in one of their rituals, and apprehended their entire old leadership group ten-to-eleven years ago.

## Known Members
No current members are known. 

... *Maybe Jelly, though. Who knows.*

## Major actions
An unknown amount of time ago, members of the Dread Priesthood constructed Dread Sanctums for an unknown purpose. Some of these Dread Sanctums had living Pokémon sealed inside, left for dead.
