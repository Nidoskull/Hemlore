## Description
**Aemilia** the **[Rookidee](Rookidee-(Species))** is an ally explorer as part of [Team Nova](Team-Nova). First seen during [Nova Mission #3], she is 22 years old and hails from [Carew City](Carew-City), from 6,000 years ago. 

She has silver bands around her legs and wears a [Rooki-Wreath](Exclusive-Items). She is quite [Impish](Nature) and may sometimes have painted patterns on herself.

Aemilia speaks [Satojiran](Satojiri).

## Relationships
Known relatives are:
- [Aemilia's Ex](Aemilia%27s-Ex) (do not ask about it)
- [Aemilia's Great-Grandfather](Aemilia%27s-Great-Grandfather) 

As a member of Team Nova, Aemilia is friends with [Hemlock the Venipede](Hemlock-the-Venipede), [Gambit the Pawniard](Gambit-the-Pawniard), [Neon the Tynamo](Neon-the-Tynamo), and [Sheo the Gastly](Sheo-the-Gastly).

Additionally, from her time in Carew City, she is associates with [Mestor Wormwood](Mestor-Wormwood) and *was* associates with his troupe of revolutionaries. None have made it to this time besides Wormwood, [Betula](Betula-the-Trevenant), their daughter [Libanos the Phantump](Libanos-the-Phantump), and Libanos's husband [Ladon the Dipplin](Ladon-the-Dipplin). [Strategos Brutus](Strategos-Brutus) lives, still, too, though the last time these two saw each other was complicated.

## History
Little is known about Aemilia's time back in Carew, and she prefers it stay that way. What little we do know, however, is that she *was* married, once, and that she has trained for six years in Carew City's Royal Guard.

During Team Nova's little time adventure, Aemilia aided Team Nova by lying to [Basileus Fictusilva](False-Basileus-Fictusilva) and accompanying the Team through the Basileus's storehouse. Additionally, during the confrontation with the false Basileus, Aemilia supported the other revolutionaries with Tailwind and item usage. She joined Team Nova back to their home time and has remained with us since.

Aemilia joined us on [Nova Mission #004](Report.Nova-Mission-4).
