## Description
**Jelly** the **[Marill](Marill%20(Species))** is a rookie explorer in the [Glaive Exploration Federation](Glaive%20Exploration%20Federation). He is 10 years old, and was born on the banks of [Arcto River](Arcto%20River). He has evolved from [Azurill](Azurill%20(Species)).

Jelly has a small [Shiny](Shiny) patch on his forehead, turning a small bit of skin teal. Additionally, he has notable eyelashes, and a small patch of extra-long fur atop his head. He usually wears his pink Team bandana around his left ear. 

Jelly is autistic and has trouble with volume control, stress management, loud environments, and reading tone in other people. We love him not despite, but because of this.

Jelly speaks Satojiran.

## Relationships
Known relatives are:
- [Evangeline Bean the Azumarill](Evangeline%20Bean) (mother)
- Daimon the Ampharos (adoptive father figure, not blood related)
- Quaggy the Quagsire (adoptive brother figure, not blood related)

As one of the founders of Team Gummy, Jelly is close to [Mars the Larvitar](Mars%20the%20Larvitar), [Volt the Shinx](Volt%20the%20Shinx) and [Arthur the Riolu](Arthur%20the%20Riolu).

## History
Born to Evangeline Bean, and raised without a father, Jelly Bean's upbringing is surprisingly enough not that notable. As he's experienced some difficulties due to his autism, Evangeline has decided to homeschool him, at least partially. 

At some point, Evangeline decided to enroll Jelly into the Glaive Expedition Federation, and the rest is history...
