*This report is missing... the following is a partial reconstruction by Hemlock.*

At some point during the mission, Team Gummy encountered a [Dread Sanctum](Dread-Priesthood), and Jelly answered the question of "What is life's greatest illusion?" with "Free will", which is the answer it required.

A Sableye attempted to murder Arthur, but his Aura Bomb ability went off which saved him.

A different coffin began oozing mucus, and when cracked open, [Djefatgoobti Meritxernen Akekhselkis](Djefatgoobti-Meritxernen-Akekhselkis) was sealed inside. Arthur notes that she should not be alive. She demands to be escorted out of the dungeon, but Team Gummy has a bounty to complete still.

Team Gummy encounters their bounty targets, the Bucktooth Gang, further in the dungeon. Arthur and Mars clean house, and Team Gummy warps out of the dungeon with their new ally in tow.
