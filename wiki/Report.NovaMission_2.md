---
As Steenee leads the team to the dungeon,  the sounds and sights of a warm meadow surround them. When they look around, they see Combee buzzing about, Skiddo galloping happily, and Bellsprout wriggling in the sun.

The team faces a [Tera](Terastallization)-Electric cottonee. Neon activates their [Shiny Surge](https://nidoskull.github.io/Hemlore/shiny_surge) to temporarily learn a move that does more damage and learns Waterfall. Hemlock eats a [Gummi](Gummi) but learns they don't work as well in dungeons.

[Monster House](Monster_House). Hemlock gets eelslapped by Neon trying to waste an orb while in tears. Neon almost gets killed but holds on with a shimmer using their second Shiny Surge, then gets an Oran Berry thrown at by Hemlock.

On the next floor we find an hollowed-out trees with claw marks on it. And our client [Kricketot](Kricketot). We continue in the dungeon to find what's up with the tree, and find a trampled bush. According to Hemlock, it was done by a Shieldon or Bastiodon, even though they don't appear in this area. Later we come accross a weird colored flower, wich seems to be a volcarona's doing.

Monster House... Or it was. All 7-9 pokemons are already defeated when we enter the room. One of the Spearows looks to have been hit by Wild Charge judging by the pollen around. Probably Volcarona pollen.

The rest of the dungeon is empty. We then find a massive clearing with piles of loot and a large Pokemon in the midde giving orders. It's a Slither Wing with a murder of Murkrow around it. The team hides in the nearby bushes, but Hemlock steps on a branch. The Slither Wing commands to seize us and we warp away with an [Escape Orb](Items).
