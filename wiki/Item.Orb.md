# Orbs
**Wonder Orbs**, usually just called Orbs, are a category of item. Each variety of **orb** acts differently. Some target yourself, others target your whole Team (regardless of distance), some target an enemy, others target the whole floor of enemies, and yet others target the floor a bit more literally.

Some Orbs have similar effects to certain [Wands](Item.Wands), such as the Blowback Orb and the Whirlwind Wand.
