**Satojiri** is a region in the world.

## Customs and Language
Notably, Satojiran has remained mostly the same for the vast, vast majority of time. If one somehow finds themselves stranded 6000 years ago, you can still perfectly understand the Pokémon who live there.

## Capital/Largest City
*Main Article: [Treasure City](City.Treasure%20City)*

Treasure City is a large city, initially known as Treasure Town. It is best known for housing [Wigglytuff's Guild](Wigglytuff%27s%20Guild), one of the most well-known Guilds there is.

## History and Myths
According to myths, Satojiri is where the [One Above](Tale.Arceus) rested after creating the world. It is where [Mew](Tale.Mew) created more mortal pokémon besides the [Twelve Originals](Tale.Original%20Twelve), with guidance from the other legendaries, after [Regigigas](Tale.Regigigas), [Groudon](Tale.Groudon) and [Heatran](Tale.Heatran) moved the continents into place following the [Primeval War](Tale.Primeval%20War).

Over 200 years ago, the [Queen of Shattered Crystals](Char.Queen%20of%20Shattered%20Crystals) ruled over Satojiri. She ordered every [Tera Crystal](Mech.Tera%20Crystal) to be destroyed out of jealousy, leaving her the only mon around to change her Type at will due to her Ability. These orders were remarkably successful, and nowadays, few Tera Crystals remain in the region, with the locations of these Crystals remaining highly guarded.

Very recently, [Team Stamp Squad](Team%20Stamp%20Squad) of the [Glaive Expedition Federation](Guild.Glaive) have found a [Tera Seed](Mech.Tera%20Crystal), and have planted it in [Dura Town](City.Dura%20Town).
