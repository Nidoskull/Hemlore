# Setnepres (Ekans & Arbok species family)
Ekans and Arbok are serpentine Pokémon of purple coloration. Their underbellies are covered in invisible ridges that allows them to grip foes and ground with surprising force. Despite what you might assume at a glance, it is not their *tail* that is that long, but rather their *torso*; that body is filled entirely with bony ribs to keep its structure!

Ekans is comparatively small. Though it averages around two meters in length, most of that is, as stated, *length* rather than height. It has a cream underbelly, alongside a cream rattle at the tip of their tail. Ekans enjoy heights such as tree branches, and enjoy being concealed in tall grass. Ekans evolves into Arbok at level 22.

Arbok are much larger, being nearly entirely purple. They have a 'hood' on their torso, which they can expand for intimidation purposes. The pattern on this hood differs per individual, though they follow broad patterns per region; usually, the pattern resembles a face, with a black mouth and red and yellow eyespots . Some may also have a black pattern on the back of their hood. 

Setnepres are most comfortable in grassy areas where they can hide. Both evolutionary stages can navigate entirely on smells picked up by flicking their tongue out, and have the ability to sense heat sources through pits on their faces.
