## Description
**Belladonna** the **[Scolipede](Species.Venipede)** is [Hemlock](Char.Hemlock%20of%20Belladonna)'s mother. She is 53 years old and lives in [Paleo City](City.Paleo%20City), working at her own bookstore.

Belladonna notably has horns curved downwards, similar to a [Houndoom](Species.Houndour)'s, and has a black mark on her face's exoskeleton that resembles eyeliner. Her carapace has a fiery tint to it, appearing nearly orange in direct sunlight, yet a deep pink in the shade. She has a purple stripe running down her back. Her eyespots are shaped like Vs, styled like an ordinary Scolipede's horns. Her tail-horns are speckled with dark markings, similar to a [Volcarona](Species.Larvesta)'s wings. She has long legs for a Scolipede, but a fairly short neck; resulting in average height across the board.

She is quite [Adamant](Mech.Nature) and is highly persistent, which is typical of Scolipede.

Belladonna speaks [Satojiran](Region.Satojiri) and [Hisinohan](Region.Hisinoh), and can understand [Alo'lolan](Region.Alo%27lola), even if she can't fluently communicate in it.

## Relationships
Known relatives are:
- [Volcarona](Char.Volcarona%20(Hemlock%27s%20Grandfather)) (Father)
- [Hemlock the Venipede](Char.Hemlock%20of%20Belladonna) (Child)
- [Foxglove the Venipede](Char.Foxglove%20the%20Venipede) (Son)
- [Nightshade the Venonat](Char.Nightshade%20the%20Venonat) (Child)

She has had several 'Flings', which is weird because that's not a move Scolipede can learn?

Belladonna often chats with [Zoey the Roserade](Char.Zoey%20the%20Roserade) through Communication Orbs. She has various business associates in Paleo City.
