`Paste icon here`
## Description
Princess **Djefatgoobti** the [Goomy](Species.Goomy) is an ally explorer as part of Team Gummy. First encountered in a [Dread Sanctum](Group.Dread%20Priesthood), she actually hails from the [Poison Kingdom](Group.Poison%20Kingdom). 

She speaks, at minimum, [Satojiran](Region.Satojiri).

## Relationships
Known relatives are:
- Djefatgoobti's mother (Presumably deceased)

As member of Team Gummy, she is friends with [Jelly](Char.Jelly%20Bean), [Volt](Char.Volt%20the%20Shinx), [Mars](Char.Mars%20the%20Larvitar), [Arthur](Char.Arthur%20the%20Riolu) and [Bronze](Char.Bronze%20the%20Beldum).

## History
Little is known about Djefatgoobti's past. Her mother worked with a Priesthood of some kind to either cure her daughter's 'illness' or bring her peace. It appears that said ritual involved sealing Djefatgoobti into a coffin inside of a Dread Sanctum.

During [Team Gummy's fourth outing](Report.Gummy4), her coffin was unsealed, and surprisingly, she was still alive. She joined Team Gummy shortly after.
