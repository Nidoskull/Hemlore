# Swellow
`Paste icon here`
## Description
**[Swellow](Species.Taillow)** is a lookout for the [Glaive Expedition Federation], alongside an explorer for the same guild. He is around thirty years old. They have also been known as Taillow, back before he evolved. He uses he/they pronouns.

Swellow is incredibly far-sighted, which is a boon when playing lookout, and a curse when trying to do literally anything else. Glasses fuck up their balance, meaning he can't fly with them on.

Swellow speaks at minimum [Satojiran](Region.Satojiri).

## Relationships
Swellow is partnered to [Latias](Tale.Latias) and has adopted [Emmie](Char.Emmie%20the%20Torchic) with her.

Swellow used to have a [Wurmple](Char.Wurmple%20(Tasty)) teammate. It is unknown what happened to them.

## History
Unfortunately, I know very little about Swellow's past. At some point he evolved from Taillow into Swellow, and that's everything I know.
