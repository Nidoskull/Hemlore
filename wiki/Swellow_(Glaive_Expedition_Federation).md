## Description
**[Swellow](Swellow_(Species))**  is a lookout for the [Glaive Expedition Federation](Glaive_Federation_Expedition), alongside an explorer for the same guild. He is around thirty years old. They have also been known as Taillow, back before he evolved.

Swellow is incredibly far-sighted, which is a boon when playing lookout, and a curse when trying to do literally anything else. Glasses fuck up their balance, meaning he can't fly with them on.

Swellow speaks at minimum [Satojiran](Satojiri).

## Relationships
Swellow has no known relatives, but *is* partnered to [Latias](Latias).

Swellow used to have an unknown teammate. It is unknown what happened to them.

## History
Unfortunately, I recall very little about Swellow's past. At some point he evolved from Taillow into Swellow, and that's everything I can remember right now.
