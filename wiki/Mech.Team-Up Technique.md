# Team-up Techniques
On occasion, when two Pokémon get to know each other better, they might figure out a way to use their strengths together to deal more damage than they could on their own.

These moves have a lot of power, and usually target more than one foe. Some may [leave debris](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_moves_that_cause_entry_hazards) or afflict the foes with [status conditions](Mech.Status%20Condition) such as Burn, Poison or Confusion. Others may grant a form of protection against foes after the Team-up Technique is completed. Most deal Type damage according to the foe's weaknesses, or deal multiple Type damages at once.
