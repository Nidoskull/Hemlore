## History

Originally based on [Guranbar Island](Loc.Guranbar%20Island), the Guild encountered a setback when a [Flame Wing](Tale.Moltres) cultist attempted to revive his deity. Fortunately, only one mon was fatally wounded; the same cultist that spurred the event.

In 6758 ISC (17 years ago), the Guild relocated to [Dura Town](City.Dura%20Town) and heavily invested in the infrastructure of the town. It has remained in this location since.

[Team Roppyaku](Team.Roppyaku) of the Guild met with [Team Profundo](Team.Profundo) to stop [Zoroark the Unkillable](Char.Zoroark%20the%20Unkillable) from entering the [Infernal Machine](Tale.Infernal%20Machine). This event causes [Larvesta](Char.Volcarona%20(Team%20Roppyaku)), [Arctibax](Char.Guildmaster%20Baxcalibur), [Zweilous](Char.Hydreigon%20(Team%20Roppyaku).md) and [Zweilous](Char.Hydreigon%20(Team%20Profundo)) to evolve.

In 6768 ISC (7 years ago), the Guild collaborated with the [Constellation Explorers Guild](Guild.Constellation%20Explorers) to track down criminals in the [Broiling Caldera](MD.Broiling%20Caldera). These criminals, the [Executors](Group.Executors), had a streak of targeting rookies. When [Drizzile's team](Team.Drizzile) found the Executors, they had prisoners, held for whatever brutalities the Executors had planned. Tepig and Bulbasaur were intent on being heroes, to save those other rookies. They did not stand a chance. Guildmaster Baxcalibur has never been angrier. The Executors are no longer a problem.

During 6775 ISC's Dura Town Festival, Litleo is Pokénapped by [Arcanine](Char.Arcanine%20(Wildfire)), and Dusknoir intervenes when [Regigigas](Tale.Regigigas) causes devastation.

[Ralmin](Char.Ralmin%20the%20Bergmite) ingests tainted [Herba Mystica](Item.Herba%20Mystica), but survives due to [Pom](Char.Pom%20the%20Honedge.md)'s intervention. The Guild members visiting Archa City are all summoned into the [Temple of the Serpent and King](City.Archa%20City) to face [Miraidon](Tale.Miraidon)). They inform Ralmin and Pom that though Ralmin was fated to die that day, Pom has defied fate, and Miraidon congratulates the two on forging their own destiny. 

[A Sableye](Char.Sableye%20(Thieve%27s%20Guild)) attempts to break into the Guild. 

[Team Orchard](Team.Orchard) finds the tomb of the [Sailor King](Char.Sailor%20King).

[Team Stamp Squad](Team.StampSquad) finds a [Tera Seed](Mech.Tera%20Crystal) and plants it in Dura Town. Shortly after, Terastalized Pokémon appear in the Mystery Dungeons near Dura Town!

Team Orchard recruits [Ostana the Hattrem](Char.Ostana%20(Ostana%27s%20Opus)) as an Alchemist for Dura Town.

Team Stamp Squad obtains a [Cryptographic Key](Item.Cryptographic%20Key) for the Guild from Mount Maw.

[Team Nova](Team.Nova) of the Guild corrects the timeline and returns [Carew City](City.Carew%20City) into existence.

Team Nova also finds one of the reliquaries holding a piece of the [Queen of Shattered Crystal](Char.Queen%20of%20Shattered%20Crystal)'s corpse.

The Guild begins a construction project for a [Freezerift Core](Item.Freezerift%20Core) for [Dura Town](City.Dura%20Town).
