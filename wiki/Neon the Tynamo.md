## Description
**Neon** the [Shiny](Shiny) **[Tynamo](Tynamo%20(Species))** is a rookie adventurer that's part of [Team Nova](Team%20Nova). Washed ashore near [Dura Town](Dura%20Town), it is 16 years old and was born in the oceans near [Sofbivia](Sofbivia). They have also been known as Ty and Tynamite before he chose its name. It uses they/it/he/she pronouns.

Neon is *incredibly* [Hasty](Nature) and as lucky as being a shiny would be.

Neon speaks [Satojiran](Satojiri) and at least one Water-type language that doesn't have a name in Satojiran ~~yet~~.

## Relationships
Neon has no known relatives due to the whole The Ocean and The Currents thing. 

As founding member of Team Nova, Neon is close to [Hemlock of Belladonna](Hemlock%20of%20Belladonna), [Gambit the Pawniard](Gambit%20the%20Pawniard), [Aemilia the Rookidee](Aemilia%20the%20Rookidee) and [Sheo the Gastly](Sheo%20the%20Gastly).

It used to know a pair of misfits back in the day, [Blink the Inkay] and [Blaster the Octillery], as well as a [Magnemite](Magnemite%20(Treasure%20City)) over in [Treasure City](Treasure%20City)

Additionally, as a shiny she has a psychic link with [Victini](Victini), who is able to grant it the power of [Shiny Surge](https://nidoskull.github.io/Hemlore/shiny%20surge) in dungeon.

## History
Not much is know of her past. On of his earliest memory is swimming near Sofblivia, where they met a duo, [Blink](Blink%20the%20Inkay) and [Blaster](Blaster%20the%20Octillery). It lived with the duo of cephalopods for a while, being a menace. Some months of this later, the now-trio was causing problems for the local Wingull population when a storm broke out. The waves dragged Neon further than it could swim, and he was swept out to the open seas. Fortunately, [Latias](Latias) found it, telling it of the [Glaive Exploration Federation](Glaive%20Exploration%20Federation) as they flew to safety.

During it's travel, they encountered [Zygarde](Zygarde%20(Myth))'s flames during a time of need, when some form of icky film threatened to drown him. Zygarde burnt away the sludge, saving Neon in the process.

Finding its way to Dura Town, Neon manages to join the guild.

During a guild mission in [Casa Victoria](Casa%20Victoria), Neon was suspected of being a card-cheat by a Murkrow after winning 2 games of Uno in a row. [Munkidori](Munkidori) of the Loyal Three put his whole hand in it's brain to see his memories, and found out she had no idea it was shiny. Instead of being exploded on the spot it was left alone since they didn't know, but anything Neon won was repossed, while it was unconssious and unable to object after having a whole hand in his brain,,,
Neon is since unable to gamble ever again until it's luck is chained, much to his dismay,,,

After an attack on the guild by Deima the Tyranitar - where Neon shatters it's effigy with an unnexplained Twinkle Tackle, High Magistrate Zygarde shows up to grant Neon (then still named Ty) a new name.
