## Description
**Neon** the [Shiny](Shiny) **[Tynamo](Tynamo%20(Species))** is a rookie adventurer that's part of [Team Nova](Team%20Nova). Washed ashore near [Dura Town](Dura%20Town), it is 16 years old and was born in the oceans near [Sofbivia](Sofbivia). They have also been known as Ty and Tynamite before he chose its name.

Neon is *incredibly* [Hasty](Nature) and as lucky as being a shiny would be.

Neon speaks [Satojiran](Satojiri) and at least one Water-type language that doesn't have a name in Satojiran ~~yet~~.

## Relationships
Neon has no known relatives due to the whole The Ocean and The Currents thing. 

As founding member of Team Nova, Neon is close to [Hemlock the Venipede](Hemlock%20the%20Venipede), [Gambit the Pawniard](Gambit%20the%20Pawniard), [Aemilia the Rookidee](Aemilia%20the%20Rookidee) and [Sheo the Gastly](Sheo%20the%20Gastly).

It used to know a pair of misfits back in the day, [Blink the Inkay] and [Blaster the Octillery]. Additionally, it knows a [Magnemite](Magnemite%20(Treasure%20City)) over in [Treasure City](Treasure%20City)
## History
Sadly, Neon doesn't know much about its own past. His earliest memory is swimming near Sofblivia, where they met a duo, [Blink](Blink%20the%20Inkay) and [Blaster](Blaster%20the%20Octillery). It lived with the duo of cephalopods for a while, being a menace.

Some months of this later, the now-trio was causing problems for the local Wingull population when a storm broke out. The waves dragged Neon further than it could swim, and he was swept out to the open seas. Fortunately, [Latias](Latias) found it, telling it of the [Glaive Exploration Federation](Glaive%20Exploration%20Federation) as they flew to safety.

Though Neon cannot place *when* this memory occurred, they encountered [Zygarde](Zygarde%20(Myth))'s flames during a time of need, when some form of icky film threatened to drown him. Zygarde burnt away the sludge, saving Neon in the process.

Finding its way to Dura Town, Neon manages to join the guild.

On a mission to [Casa Victoria](Casa%20Victoria), Neon learns that it's a Shiny in the most traumatizing way possible (through monkey hand in brain).
