## History

Originally based on [Guranbar Island](Guranbar%20Island), the Guild encountered a setback when a [Flame Wing](Moltres%20(Myth)) cultist attempted to revive his deity. Fortunately, only one mon was fatally wounded; the same cultist that spurred the event.

In 6758 ISC (17 years ago), the Guild relocated to [Dura Town](Dura%20Town) and heavily invested in the infrastructure of the town. It remains in this location since.

[Team Roppyaku](Team%20Roppyaku) of the Guild met with [Team Profundo](Team%20Profundo) to stop [Zoroark the Unkillable](Zoroark%20the%20Unkillable) from entering the [Infernal Machine](Infernal%20Machine%20(Tale).md). This event causes [Larvesta](Volcarona%20(Team%20Roppyaku)), [Arctibax](Guildmaster%20Baxcalibur), [Zweilous](Hydreigon%20(Team%20Roppyaku)) and [Zweilous](Hydreigon%20(Team%20Profundo)) to evolve.

It is unknown what exactly happened, but the team formed by [Drizzile](Drizzile%20(Glaive%20Expedition%20Federation)) loses two of its members in 6768 ISC (7 years ago).

During 6775 ISC's Dura Town Festival, Litleo is Pokénapped, and Dusknoir intervenes when [Regigigas](Regigigas) causes devastation.

[Ralmin](Ralmin%20the%20Bergmite) ingests tainted [Herba Mystica](Herba%20Mystica), but survives due to [Pom](Pom%20the%20Honedge)'s intervention. The Guild members visiting Archa City are all summoned into the [Temple of the Serpent and King](Archa%20City) to face [Miraidon](Miraidon%20(Myth)). They inform Ralmin and Pom that though Ralmin was fated to die that day, Pom has defied fate, and Miraidon congratulates the two on forging their own destiny. 

A Sableye attempts to break into the Guild. 

[Team Orchard](Team%20Orchard) finds the tomb of the [Sailor King](Sailor%20King).

[Team Stamp Squad](Team%20Stamp%20Squad) finds a [Tera Seed](Tera%20Crystal) and plants it in Dura Town. Shortly after, Terastalized Pokémon appear in the Mystery Dungeons near Dura Town!

Team Orchard recruits [Ostana the Hattrem](Ostana%20(Ostana%27s%20Opus)) as an Alchemist for Dura Town.

Team Stamp Squad obtains a [Cryptographic Key](Cryptographic%20Key) for the Guild from Mount Maw.

[Team Nova](Team%20Nova) of the Guild corrects the timeline and returns [Carew City](Carew%20City) into existence.

Team Nova also finds one of the reliquaries holding a piece of the [Queen of Shattered Crystal](Queen%20of%20Shattered%20Crystal)'s corpse.
