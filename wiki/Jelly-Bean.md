## Description
**Jelly** the **[Marill](Marill-(Species))** is a rookie explorer in the [Glaive Exploration Federation](Glaive-Exploration-Federation). He is 10 years old, and was born on the banks of [Arcto River](Arcto-River). He has [evolved](Evolution) from [Azurill](Azurill-(Species)).

Jelly has a small [Shiny](Shiny) patch on his forehead, turning a small bit of skin teal. Additionally, he has notable eyelashes, and a small patch of extra-long fur atop his head. He usually wears his pink Team bandana around his left ear. 

Jelly is autistic and has ADHD. He has trouble with volume control, stress management, loud environments, and reading tone in other people. We love him not despite, but because of this.

Jelly speaks Satojiran.

## Relationships
Known relatives are:
- [Evangeline Bean the Azumarill](Evangeline-Bean) (mother)
- [Mint the Chespin](Mint-the-Chespin) (new dad now.)
- [Daimon the Ampharos](Daimon-the-Ampharos) (adoptive uncle figure, not blood related)
- [Quaggy the Quagsire](Quaggy-the-Quagsire) (adoptive brother figure, not blood related)

As one of the founders of Team Gummy, Jelly is close to [Mars the Larvitar](Mars-the-Larvitar), [Volt the Shinx](Volt-the-Shinx), [Arthur the Riolu](Arthur-the-Riolu) and [Djefatgoobti Meritxernen Akekhselkis](Djefatgoobti-Meritxernen-Akekhselkis)

## History
Jelly's egg had some complications before hatching. However, thanks to Evangeline's unconditional love, and the support of Daimon, and a little help from [Giratina](Giratina-(Myth)), he became the little blue boy we know nowadays.

Born to Evangeline Bean, and raised without a true father, but many false stepfathers, Jelly Bean's upbringing is surprisingly enough fairly simple... discounting that one incident, but let us not speak of it, hm?

As he's experienced some difficulties due to his autism, Evangeline has decided to homeschool him, at least partially. 

At some point, Evangeline decided to enroll Jelly into the Glaive Expedition Federation, and the rest is history...

The same love that gave Jelly a chance at life let him [Evolve](Evolution) despite the mystery of Mew's darkness afflicting the whole Guild.
