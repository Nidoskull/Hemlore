# Illumina Quality
Illumina Quality, usually shortened to **IQ**, is a measure of one's strengths and unique traits. The higher your IQ, the likelier it is that you're capable of some unique traits. 
## List of IQ Talents
- Bodyguard - If an ally is at 25% or less HP, you can choose to jump in front of an attack meant for them.
- Item Seeker - Effect unknown (to me). Presumably: When looking for loot, you may encounter more loot than usual.
- Nontraitor - You will never attack your allies, even when confused.
- Orb Specialist - Effect unknown (to me). Presumably: When using Orbs, there is a chance they may not be consumed on use, and/or you can use them as a free action at the start of a battle.
- Pokémon Seeker - Effect unknown (to me). Presumably: When looking for Pokémon, you may encounter more Pokémon than usual.
- Self-Curer - You have a chance to heal your own status effects at the end of your turn. You will always heal from them at the end of a battle.
- Survivalist - Effect unknown (to me).
- Thrown Specialist - Deal more damage when throwing or hurling items.
- Wand Specialist - Wands are less likely to break, and you can use one as a free action at the start of any battle.
