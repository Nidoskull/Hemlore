## History
Titania hatched alone. Her earliest memories involve rolling with [Snorunt](Species.Snorunt), chasing [Spheal](Species.Spheal), and escaping rampaging [Abomasnow](Species.Snover). Ae learned how to beat back [Murkrow](Species.Murkrow) with nothing but a stick, how to climb a tree to eat the [berries](Item.Berry) it grew, and how to make a fire. Without friends, the quiet windy nights were his company.

Isolation did very little for nor social skills. Combative, impulsive, and naïve; it is a miracle gup survived. Wandering further and further from rocs hatchgrounds, Titania found bustling cities, quiet rural towns, and endless seas. A new appreciation was kindled; this world was beautiful, and kie wanted to see all of it. 

Sneaking into a school during one of mim's longer stays in a city, Titania learned to read, and learned of many great adventurers. They wondered if they could see the world if they were an adventurer. Trying to be a hero, he often got itself into trouble. 

During one of kier 'missions', sie encountered an actual adventurer; a snowy white [Vulpix](Species.Vulpix), like the ones back where thon hatched. Adorned with a sparkling ribbon, he spoke.

"Oh, are you on an expedition too?"

"...A what?"

The Alo'lolan Vulpix introduced himself as [Cyren](Char.Cyren%20the%20Vulpix) and explained—in between frequent interruptions—what a Guild was, how Dungeons worked, and what Cyren's team does. Titania *immediately* wanted to know how to join a Guild.

Cyren gave glub directions towards [Dura Town](City.Dura%20Town), as it was the closest Guild to their location, and the rest is history.
