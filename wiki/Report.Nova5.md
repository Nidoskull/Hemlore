---

Baxcalibur guides Team Nova and Ishy to the Rumbling Wastes. 

Once inside, Team Nova and Ishy immediately run into a group of Pokémon. Neon *very nearly* goes down, but Ishy takes out the mon that would KO her. After defeating the group of Cubone, Magnemite, Goldeen and Voltorb, Neon discovers a Dark/Psychic type back passage. Hemlock opens the way with Bug Bite.

Following that back passage leads the Team to floor 3. A mysterious energy ripples through the dungeon. The Team emerges into a room containing just one... Pokémon? Calling it a Pokémon is generous. A swirling mass of black tentacles and growths, with a single blue 'eye' in the middle of it. It notices the Team and approaches. Hemlock cautiously calls out to the *thing*, and one of the tentacles morphs into a three-clawed hand, reaching out. Neon Thunder Waves it, and it roars out in anger, using Dark Void to put Neon into a horrific nightmare. The *thing* is revealed to be [Darkrai](Darkrai), and he grabs Gambit to absorb his life force. [Blaziken](Char.Blaziken%20(Team%20Aquaflame)) jumps in, using Close Combat on Darkrai; "Something set him off, he's not... *Him* right now!" Blaziken sends Gambit home using his Explorer Badge to recover, and tosses a [Silver Chesto Berry](Berry) at Hemlock to wake Neon up. Hemlock, Neon and Ishy run off to ~~get away from the murdertentacles~~ find [Feraligatr](Char.Feraligatr%20(Team%20Aquaflame)) as Blaziken [Mega Evolves](Mech.Mega%20Evolution). Fortunately, they do find Feraligatr! Leading her to the battle zone, Feraligatr *also* Mega Evolves, and after Blaziken assures the Team they've got it, Hemlock, Neon and Ishy immediately turn tail and run towards the stairs, encountering [Sceptile](Char.Sceptile%20(Wigglytuff%27s)). Pointing him towards the Horrors, Team Nova clambers down the stairs as they hear another Mega Stone activating.

On Floor 4, Hemlock's bag suddenly has a pair of eyes. [Sheo](Char.Sheo%20the%20Gastly) snuck along, still at level 9! She joins the party, filling the slot left open by an injured Gambit. Which is actually pretty good, since the Team immediately runs into a Tera-Fairy Amaura. Neons fails to defuse the situation, and with a power boost from their Pendants, Team Nova is forced to take them out, with Sheo getting the final hit. ~~Team Nova forgets to check out the shrine, but with the power of hindsight, it's likely a shrine towards [Thundurus](Tale.Thundurus).~~

On Floor 5, the Team once again runs into a gang of Pokémon that refuses to back down. When a Makuhita tries to use Knock Off on Sheo, Hemlock refuses to let Sheo get KO'd, taking the hit instead. This increases Sheo's and Hemlock's bond enough to learn a new [Team-Up Technique](Mech.Team-Up%20Technique.md), Spectral Toxin-jector. Finishing the battle, Team Nova continues exploring, and runs into [Dusknoir](Char.Dusknoir%20(Glaive)) and [Garganacl](Char.Garganacl%20(Dura%20Town)), who request their help in investigating Garganacl's family tomb. Entering the tomb, Hemlock finds a blue crystal that pulsates with Water-type energy. Dusknoir IDs it as a Water [Tera Orb](Mech.Terastalization). Neon and Sheo find some dragon scales. Hemlock and Ishy reach for some suspiciously dustless urns, when the crypt suddenly begins to shake and collapse. Debris falls from above and Dusknoir stretches himself out over Team Nova to shield them, getting clubbed in the back by the falling rocks. Fortunately, it settles quickly, but unfortunately, Dusknoir is in a lot of pain. Fortunately again, Dusknoir has an Energy Root in his bag, which is enough to get him floating again. The crypt's back wall has fully collapsed, and reveals a deep, *deep* hole. Dusknoir's investigation concludes with a "We're coming back later with a more prepared team." and the crypt is cordoned off. Team Nova continues their mission.

Entering Floor 6, it's raining, and the current surges through the floor. Team Nova immediately runs into a pair of Terastalized Pokémon; a Tera-Fairy Amaura, and a Tera-Fighting Tyrunt. Hemlock and Sheo handily take out the Fairy-type Amaura, and in response, the Tyrunt calls for help. Another Tyrunt, this one Tera-Ice, appears. Neon's paralysis prevents them from moving, but still, one of the Tyrunts manages to get out an Ancient Power, targeting Hemlock. Hemlock *should* faint. The attack *should* deal 205% of Hemlock's health, enough to damage a nearby friend. But the nearby friend is Sheo. So Hemlock refuses. Sheo infuses some of her energy into Hemlock, Terastalizing it into a Ghost-type. And Hemlock stays conscious, with 1 HP. Hemlock answers with a Rollout, taking out the Ice-type Tyrunt, and Sheo follows up with a Sludge Bomb, taking out the other Tyrunt.

Floor 7 opens into a small arena, with a Tera-Water Hariyama and his group of Makuhita standing between Team Nova and the stairs. The bright sun empowers Hemlock's Solar Beam, and Sheo follows up with an Energy Ball. With the loss of their leader, all six Makuhita use Belly Drum, and munch on their held Oran Berries to recover. Thank *fuck* for [Victini's help](Mech.Shiny%20Surge), granting Neon a temporary Discharge, defeating half of the Makuhita. Ishy follows up and KOs the remaining three with a well-tuned Disarming Voice.

On Floor 8, Team Nova immediately runs into another back passage; this one being a Fairy-Steel door. Following it, they end up on Floor 10, where not much of interest happens.

At the end of the dungeon, on the peak of the plateau, Team Nova finds an arena. In the center stands an idol of [Thundurus](Tale.Thundurus) in its Therian forme, carved from Thunder Stone. At the foot of this idol stands its guardian, Iron Hands. He asks Team Nova to identify themselves, alongside their purpose. Upon learning that they are here to obtain an item attuned to a Pokémon borne of thunder, dozens of Pokémon around begin to gather, stamping their feet and chanting to challenge Team Nova. Iron Hands stops them, declaring he would be the one to challenge them. If Team Nova was victorious, they would be granted a piece of the Lightning Oni's power. If they lost, however, they would never be permitted to return to this place again. 

Entering a battle stance, Hemlock, Neon, Ishy and Sheo draw on the power of their Pendants. Sheo throws out a Sludge Bomb, while Hemlock turns the weather to sun. Iron Hands, in response, uses Swords Dance. Neon calls upon Victini's power, granting Hemlock and Gambit a tighter bond despite their distance, and boosting all of Team Nova's experience by 500 points. Neon's Liquidation and Ishy's Hex knock down Iron Hands to 63 HP, but Iron Hands tightens its focus, and aims at Neon. The damage would be enough to knock out Hemlock and Ishy as well. But Sheo doesn't let it hit any of her friends, jumping in front of it like her big bug sibling would, and Focus Punch has no effect on ghosts. They answer with another Sludge Bomb, and Iron Hands goes down.

Iron Hands is swiftly revived by one of his retainers, and looks upon Team Nova with pride. He informs them that they fight well, and grants Team Nova a piece of Pure Storm Essence, the Electric [Protean Ingredient](Item.Protean%20Ingredient). Sheo, filled with courage, speaks. 

"I did it for you guys..."
