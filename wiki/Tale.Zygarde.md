# High Magistrate Zygarde

## Description
Zygarde is a legendary Pokemon and High Magistrate of the Sweetest Lands. They hold the power of Justice and Retribution, as well as transing your gender. They are also known as God of Order and The One who Balances All 

Their body is comprised of hundreds of independently thinking cells called Aediles, including 10 hearts. They can change between 10%, 50% and Complete form at will, though it takes energy from Them; so They're most often seen as Their 10% forms when travelling.

## Relationships
Zygarde has siblings in the form of Their brother [Yveltal](Tale.Yveltal) and sister [Xerneas](Tale.Xerneas)

Also They're unofficialy [team Nova](Team.Nova)'s ally since [Nova's fourth mission](Report.Nova4)

## History
Zygarde first showed up at the Guild to grant Neon a new name, after it called upon Their powers to destroy Deima. After some loredrop, They then granted it a bangle with an emera linked to it's lost kin.

They were there for the whole of [Nova Mission 4](Report.Nova4), during wich They absorb Gambit for a while and grants the team one gift each.

In a joint mission this time, one aedile joins the team (wich is not a good sign). This time They absorb Hemlock and Neon, forcibly evolving the fish at the same time to avoid it being absorbed permanently.

## Trivia
- "Friend of Zygarde" is a popular euphemism among young transgender Pokemon as Zygarde is the Pokemon to go to if you need your gender changed.
