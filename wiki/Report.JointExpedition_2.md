---
The Teams arrive at Rubedo Cliffs. The dungeon's cliffs are imposing and crawling with Pokémon.

Mint and Hemlock find a back route on floor 1, but a barrier in the way is charged with Water-type energy. Neon hits it with Spark, breaking it down and leading to the stairs. 

The Teams find [a lone Beldum](Bronze_the_Beldum) in the rooms with the stairs, and Volt manages to spook them into being an Ally. After 'finishing' the 'battle', a Treasure Chest appears, holding 3 Infernal Metal, 6 Steel Tera Shards, 201 Poké, and 4 Gold Bullion. Neon, Mint, and Volt all level up.

On floor 2, we run into the [Constellation guild](Constellation_Explorers_Guild)'s [Guildmaster Rigel](Guildmaster_Rigel), accompanying [Antares](Antares_the_Skorupi) on a catch-up mission. Antares chooses to duel Volt, and Volt pulls out the surprise Fire Fang, winning the duel. Volt gets homesick and is sent home.

Following Rigel's directions, we encounter 7 wild Pokémon, which we defeat almost without taking damage. Hemlock levels up to level 15.

On floor 3, we encounter [Arcanine](Arcanine_(Bounty_Hunter)). Sobble grabs an Emera from his bag and presses it directly against his chest. Sobble uses Origin Pulse, taking half his health in damage and losing HP IVs in the process. Neon in a quick moment of adrenaline finishes Arcanine off, and Sobble warps everyone out before collapsing in front of the Guild.
