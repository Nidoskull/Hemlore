# World
_This article is a stub. You can help by expanding it._

The Pokémon world is exactly what you'd expect; a world divided into regions with each their own customs, cultures, and traditions.

For unknown reasons, certain areas in the world are prone to spontaneous manifestation of [Mystery Dungeons](Mystery%20Dungeon), filled with loot, potential allies, but most of all danger. Certain regions have higher concentrations of Mystery Dungeons than others; though this may simply be due to those regions being mapped better than others.

Many Pokémon have banded together in [Guilds](Guild) to aid those who need help. Guilds consist of adventurous Pokémon not afraid of danger if it means they can help keep Pokémon safe.

# Calendar
Several calendars are still in use around the world, however most Pokémon are at minimum aware of the Interregional Standard Calendar. Some underwater civilizations follow Annuls Kyambrie, for example.

The Interregional Standard Calendar follows a fifteen-month year. One month at the summer solstice is but seven days long, and one month at the winter solstice is, too. All other months have twenty-seven days. When needed, one extra day is added to the last month of the year, known as [Giratina's Day](Giratina%20(Myth)). Weeks are seven days, and days are twenty-four hours long.

# List of Regions
