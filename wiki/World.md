# World
_This article is a stub. You can help by expanding it._

The Pokémon world is exactly what you'd expect; a world divided into regions with each their own customs, cultures, and traditions.

For unknown reasons, certain areas in the world are prone to spontaneous manifestation of [Mystery Dungeons](Mystery%20Dungeon), filled with loot, potential allies, but most of all danger. Certain regions have higher concentrations of Mystery Dungeons than others; though this may simply be due to those regions being mapped better than others.

Many Pokémon have banded together in [Guilds](Guild) to aid those who need help; multiple Guilds have been established in each Region, consisting of adventurous Pokémon not afraid of danger if it means they can help keep Pokémon safe.

_Main article: [Alo'lola](Alo%27lola)_

A tropical region composed of several islands. Alo'lolan Pokémon have very distinct customs; they worship the four Tapus ([Tapu Koko](Tapu%20Koko%20(Myth)), [Tapu Lele](Tapu%20Lele%20(Myth)), [Tapu Bulu](Tapu%20Bulu%20(Myth)) and [Tapu Fini](Tapu%20Fini%20(Myth))) alongside the Celestials ([Solgaleo](Solgaleo%20(Myth)), [Lunala](Lunala%20(Myth)), and on occasion [Necrozma](Necrozma%20(Myth))).

## Atransei
_Main article: [Atransei](Atransei)_

An island off the coast of [Hisinoh](Hisinoh), shaped peculiarly like [the One Above All](Arceus%20Myth). Pokémon from Atransei are often trained in some manner of weaponry.

## Cabodea
_Main article: [Cabodea](Cabodea)_

A region that lies close to Lumalos. A large crater lies at the center, and Pokémon have mentioned seeing some strange things in there. It is rumored that the [Winged King](Koraidon%20(Myth)) and the [Iron Serpent](Miraidon%20(Myth)) may have origins from this region. 

## Eastern Archipelago

A small, mountainous region.
## Galtunar
_Main article: [Galtunar](Galtunar)_

An island off the coast of Lumalos, sporting a generally temperate climate except at its very south, where the snow and ice linger. [Calyrex](Calyrex%20(Myth)) holds the position of King.

## Hasorem
_Main article: [Hasorem](Hasorem)_

Hasorem is a semi-tropical region comprised mostly of water, with a desert near its center. [Groudon](Groudon%20(Myth)), [Kyogre](Kyogre%20(Myth)) and [Rayquaza](Rayquaza%20(Myth) are especially venerated here.

## Hisinoh
_Main article: [Hisinoh](Hisinoh)_

A northern region that's partially covered in snow at all times. It is said that [Heatran](Heatran%20(Myth))'s heart warms the region to keep it habitable. The mountain at its center was once a location of worship for the Firstborne Three ([Palkia](Palkia%20), [Dialga](Dialga%20(Myth)) and [Giratina](Giratina%20(Myth))) and the [One Above](Arceus%20(Myth)).

## Hismiya
_Main article: [Hismiya](Hismiya)_

An island just off the coast of Hisinoh. Its Rangers take on a role similar to, but not identical to our [Peacekeepers](Peackeepers).

## Isshu
_Main article: [Isshu](Isshu)_

A highly-industrialized region with several large cities. The locals seem split about whether one's ideals or the truth are more important. Additionally, the locals seem tetchy when it comes to the Eon Twins...
## Lentclic
_Main article: [Lentclic](Lentclic)_

A region with stunning vistas. (i've never played pokémon Snap.)

## Kareblye

A fairly traditional region that mostly keeps to itself. Many Pokémon, even those not actually born in Kareblye, consider Kareblye the best region for some reason. Shares a border with Krysivgo.

## Korakita
_Main article: [Korakita](Korakita)_

A small region sort of near Cabodea. 

## Krysivgo
_Main article: [Krysivgo](Krysivgo)_

A traditional region that sees a little more cultural exchange, but is constantly overshadowed by Kareblye to its west. Krysivgoan Pokémon tend to follow [Ho-Oh](Ho-Oh%20(Myth)) and [Lugia](Lugia%20(Myth))'s teachings.
