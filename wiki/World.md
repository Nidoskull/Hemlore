# World
_This article is a stub. You can help by expanding it._

The Pokémon world is exactly what you'd expect; a world divided into regions with each their own customs, cultures, and traditions.

For unknown reasons, certain areas in the world are prone to spontaneous manifestation of [Mystery Dungeons](Mystery%20Dungeon), filled with loot, potential allies, but most of all danger. Certain regions have higher concentrations of Mystery Dungeons than others; though this may simply be due to those regions being mapped better than others.

Many Pokémon have banded together in [Guilds](Guild) to aid those who need help; multiple Guilds have been established in each Region, consisting of adventurous Pokémon not afraid of danger if it means they can help keep Pokémon safe.
