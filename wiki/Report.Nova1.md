# Mission Report: Team Nova #001
**Dungeon**: [Sunlit Meadows](MD.Sunlit%20Meadows)

**Members**: [Team Nova](Team.Nova): [Hemlock](Char.Hemlock%20of%20Belladonna) (level 5), [Neon](Char.Neon%20the%20Tynamo) (level 6), [Gambit](Char.Gambit%20the%20Pawniard) (level 5)

**Missions**: Item retrieval - Spoink's orb

---
As the sun rains down on our trio of intrepid heroes, the faint sound of buzzing [Combee](Species.Combee) and galloping [Skiddo](Species.Skiddo) disrupts the silence of the Sunlit Meadows.

The team finds a Ghost [Shard Box](Item.Shard%20Box). Néon gets in a fight alone until the others come to help. Neon almost dies to a single Bellsprout.
On the 3rd floor the terrain becomes grassy, then we find a strange rock with something possibly inside; and even laterer we find Spoink's orb.

[Monster house](Mech.Mystery%20Dungeon)! Hemlock gets KO'd and then not and then escapes the floor while Neon and Gambit stay and fight the remaining pokémon.

On the last floor of the dungeon we find a [Ditto](Species.Ditto) that rewards us with a move from a line's parent. Gambit takes up Sucker Punch.

We finish the dungeon and warp to the guild.
