As Steenee leads the team to a massive pit in the ground, the smell of pure salt hits their nose. They can see Nacli and Drilbur milling about the mines as Dwebble and Bunnelby loiter around basking on outcroppings in the cliff face.

After a short battle, and getting away from a Tera Elektrik Diggersby, the team examines a shrine with a crumpled copper statue. Aemilia forgets what a Pokemon is. Gambit recognizes it as a dark type with a mask and a stone flower, as well as what looks like a tera crystal. At the bottom of the statue a plaque reads "Let her jealousy be her only memory", it's Meowscarada, the Queen of Shattered Crystals.

Out of nowhere the statues rises up due to electromagnetism from Neon's body. There's a reliquary inside wich Neon opens magnetically, and inside is a skeletonized paw made out of Elektric Tera Crystal. that's a problem for Dusknoir when they get back now. The paw goes back in the box and the box inside Hem's bag.

Almost immediately after, the ground cracks and opens up under Hemlock and Gambit. Aemilia tries to grab Hem and guide it's fall toward a soft pile of leaves. Neon tries sparking Gambit to do an approximation of Magnet Rise, as advised by Aemilia. The group fell two whole floors.

The team finds a room with half a dozen fainted mons, including a G-max Copperrahja and a Mega Garchomp. Bright green flames around them. All of them are explorers from the Subterra guild. The escape trigger on their badges had been disabled for some reason, so Hemlock warps them out with it's badge to the Glaive Guild.

_Meanwhile, at the guild._ A group of six fainted pokemons appears on Baxcalibur's front step.

_Meanwhile, back in dungeon._ During a fight, Neon activates the Bleak Cyclone Emera from its heirloom and summons a Blizzard during a fight where Hemlock and Aemilia fainted. When they leave though, they feel a presence in the room.

On the next floor, they find a single Zygarde cell! The aedile climbs up Gambit's leg and sits on his head. Along with the aedile, the team finds tunnel byproduct. Someone has been mining here.

After a short battle, the group finds... Minstrel Kricketune! He's looking for a shrine to Zygarde's twelve legates to get inspiration. He's escorted by Menni the Salamence and his niece Valeria Racotta Albion Trusine Speares Wanless VI! The group talks, mostly about Ralmin, she reveals she prefers girls, flirts with Aemilia, and they depart. 

[Monster House!](Mech.Mystery Dungeon) The Aedile gets first dibs and makes Gambit a massive sword out of dust on the battlefield, taking out five pokemons in one swing. Hemlock and Neon then use their Team-up Move Scuttle Shock to take out the remaining pokemons. 

The team then investigate a brine pool, where a Titan Cradily, the same Team Orchard fought before, is sitting in. The rest of the team hides behind rocks before Gambit and the aedile walk up to it and it SPRAYS UP, throwing the Titan into another brine pool in the dungeon.
