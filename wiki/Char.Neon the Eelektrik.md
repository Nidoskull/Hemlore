## Description
**Neon** the [Shiny](Mech.Shiny) **[Eelektrik](Species.Tynamo)** is a rookie adventurer that's part of [Team Nova](Team.Nova). Washed ashore near [Dura Town](Dura%20Town), it is 16 years old and was born in the ocean in an unknown location. They have also been known as Ty ~~and Tynamite~~ before he chose its name. She uses they/it/he/she pronouns.

Neon is *incredibly* [Hasty](Mech.Nature) and as lucky as being a shiny would be. Due to evolving early to special circumstances, He's a different color than regular Eelektrik, or a Shiny Eelektrik for that matter; Neon is a green incredibly similar to [Zygarde](Tale.Zygarde)'s coloration. Its usually-yellow belly and fins are closer to Tynamo's blue-ish white, and her lips and tail fin are similarly colored like Tynamo's mouth.

Neon speaks [Satojiran](Region.Satojiri) and at least one Water-type language that doesn't have a name in Satojiran ~~yet~~.

## Relationships
Neon has no known relatives due to the whole The Ocean and The Currents thing. 

As founding member of Team Nova, Neon is close to [Hemlock of Belladonna](Char.Hemlock%20of%20Belladonna), [Gambit the Pawniard](Char.Gambit%20the%20Pawniard), [Aemilia the Rookidee](Char.Aemilia%20the%20Rookidee) and [Sheo the Gastly](Char.Sheo%20the%20Gastly).

It used to know a pair of misfits back in the day, [Blink the Inkay](Char.Blink%20the%20Inkay) and [Blaster the Octillery](Char.Blaster%20the%20Octillery), as well as a [Magnemite](Char.Magnemite%20(Treasure%20City)) over in [Treasure City](City.Treasure%20City)

Additionally, as a shiny she has a psychic link with [Victini](Tale.Victini). Neon also got close with [Zygarde](Tale.Zygarde) during various missions, and was saved by [Latias](Tale.Latias) one time before joining the guild.

## History
Since birth Neon was constantly getting dragged by currents all over the globe and as such doesn't have a definite place of origin. They'd end up in different shoals for a short while before drifting again. 

In one of these shoals, they met a duo of cephalomons, [Blink](Char.Blink%20the%20Inkay) and [Blaster](Char.Blaster%20the%20Octillery). It lived with the duo of cephalopods for a while, being a menace to the inhabitants of the [underwater ruins](World#solfbivia). Some months of this later, the now-trio was causing problems for the local [Wingull](Species.Wingull) population when a storm broke out. 

The waves dragged Neon further than it could swim, and he was swept out to the open seas. Fortunately, [Latias](Tale.Latias) found her, telling it of the [Glaive Expedition Federation](Guild.Glaive) as they flew to safety. Neon then took to join the guild and started travelling in it's direction.

During its travel, they encountered Zygarde's flames during a time of need, when some form of icky film threatened to drown him. Zygarde burnt away the sludge, saving Neon in the process.

Finding its way to [Dura Town](City.Dura%20Town), Neon manages to join the guild into Team Nova.

During a guild mission in [Casa Victoria](City.Casa%20Victoria), Neon was suspected of being a card-cheat by a Murkrow after winning 2 games of Uno in a row. [Munkidori](Tale.Munkidori) of the Loyal Three put his whole hand in its brain to see his memories, and found out she had no idea it was shiny. Instead of being exploded on the spot, it was left alone since she didn't know, but anything it won was repossessed, while it was unconscious and unable to object after having a whole hand in his brain. Neon is since unable to gamble ever again until its luck is chained, much to his dismay.

In a mission into the past, Neon along with Ladon helped resurect the late Basillina to life with a joint [Shiny Surge](Mech.Shiny#shiny-surge)

After an attack on the guild by [Deima the Tyranitar](Char.Deima%20the%20Tyranitar), where Neon shatters her effigy with a Victini-granted Twinkle Tackle, [High Magistrate Zygarde](Tale.Zygarde) shows up to grant Neon (then still named Ty) a new name. 

On a [Joint Expedition](Report.Joint5) with Litleo, Hemlock, Volt, Ralmin and Mint, Zygarde forcibly evolved Neon to prevent him from being permanently absorbed by Them after stepping in along with Hemlock to help them reach their 50% form to defeat an Aberration Pokemon.
