## Description
**Néon** the [Shiny](Mech.Shiny) **[Eelektrik](Species.Tynamo)** is a rookie adventurer that's part of [Team Nova](Team.Nova). Washed ashore near [Dura Town](Dura%20Town), it is 16 years old and was born in the oceans near [Solfbivia](Region.Solfbivia). They have also been known as Ty and Tynamite before he chose its name. She uses they/it/he/she pronouns.

Néon is *incredibly* [Hasty](Mech.Nature) and as lucky as being a shiny would be. Unlike a regular Eelektrik, or a Shiny Eelektrik for that matter, Néon is a green incredibly similar to [Zygarde](Tale.Zygarde)'s coloration. Its usually-yellow belly and fins are closer to Tynamo's blue-ish white, and her lips and tail fin are similarly colored like Tynamo's mouth.

Néon speaks [Satojiran](Region.Satojiri) and at least one Water-type language that doesn't have a name in Satojiran ~~yet~~.

## Relationships
Néon has no known relatives due to the whole The Ocean and The Currents thing. 

As founding member of Team Nova, Néon is close to [Hemlock of Belladonna](Char.Hemlock%20of%20Belladonna), [Gambit the Pawniard](Char.Gambit%20the%20Pawniard), [Aemilia the Rookidee](Char.Aemilia%20the%20Rookidee) and [Sheo the Gastly](Char.Sheo%20the%20Gastly).

It used to know a pair of misfits back in the day, [Blink the Inkay](Char.Blink%20the%20Inkay) and [Blaster the Octillery](Char.Blaster%20the%20Octillery), as well as a [Magnemite](Char.Magnemite%20(Treasure%20City)) over in [Treasure City](City.Treasure%20City)

Additionally, as a shiny she has a psychic link with [Victini](Tale.Victini), who is able to grant it the power of [Shiny Surge](Mech.Shiny%20Surge) in a dungeon.

## History
Not much is known of her past. One of his earliest memory is swimming near Solfbivia, where they met a duo, [Blink](Char.Blink%20the%20Inkay) and [Blaster](Char.Blaster%20the%20Octillery). It lived with the duo of cephalopods for a while, being a menace. Some months of this later, the now-trio was causing problems for the local [Wingull](Species.Wingull) population when a storm broke out. The waves dragged Néon further than it could swim, and he was swept out to the open seas. Fortunately, [Latias](Tale.Latias) found her, telling it of the [Glaive Expedition Federation](Guild.Glaive) as they flew to safety.

During its travel, they encountered [Zygarde](Tale.Zygarde)'s flames during a time of need, when some form of icky film threatened to drown him. Zygarde burnt away the sludge, saving Néon in the process.

Finding its way to [Dura Town](City.Dura%20Town), Néon manages to join the guild.

During a guild mission in [Casa Victoria](City.Casa%20Victoria), Néon was suspected of being a card-cheat by a Murkrow after winning 2 games of Uno in a row. [Munkidori](Tale.Munkidori) of the Loyal Three put his whole hand in its brain to see his memories, and found out she had no idea it was shiny. Instead of being exploded on the spot it was left alone since they didn't know, but anything Néon won was repossessed, while it was unconscious and unable to object after having a whole hand in his brain. Néon is since unable to gamble ever again until its luck is chained, much to his dismay.

After an attack on the guild by [Deima the Tyranitar](Char.Deima%20the%20Tyranitar) - where Néon shatters it's effigy with an unexplained Twinkle Tackle, [High Magistrate Zygarde](Tale.Zygarde) shows up to grant Néon (then still named Ty) a new name. 

On a Joint Expedition with Litleo, Hemlock, Volt, Ralmin and Mint, Zygarde forcibly evolved Néon to prevent him from being permanently absorbed by Them.
