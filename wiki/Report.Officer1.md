Mail (Swellow): "Weird". Swellow unconvinced we're getting all the deliveries we should be. Latias investigating. Storm season off Orhode may be worse than presumed. Volcarona will also investigate. Suspicious activity matching with the Wind God's Devout. 

Baxcalibur wants research into Mount Maw's cultural history, and if there's any Pokémon living there that might be strong enough to knock Baxcalibur off the temple and fast enough to not see them. 

Darmanitan: No interest in any experienced Forgemasters coming to Dura Town. Economy's fucked, the Guild is the only support network. Dura Town is cripplingly in debt, which makes it much, much harder to Not Be in debt. Mons don't want to move here without amenities, amenities won't be here without Mons. See if we can grow population? Baxcalibur asks how ridiculous it would be to just fund the forge themselves. 50/50 shot Bronze hatched with a Creation Lathe. 

Volcarona formally wishes to rejoin the Guild as part-time explorer. Solgaleo and Necrozma take priority, and also The Sun. Rescue services in Eastern Archipelago have mostly been taken over by Vulcan and Sakura's friends.
