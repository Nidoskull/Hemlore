## History

Originally based on [Guranbar Island](Guranbar_Island), the Guild encountered a setback when a [Flame Wing](Moltres_(Myth)) cultist attempted to revive his deity. Fortunately, only one mon was fatally wounded; the same cultist that spurred the event.

In 6758 ISC (17 years ago), the Guild relocated to [Dura Town](Dura_Town) and heavily invested in the infrastructure of the town. It remains in this location since.

[Team Roppyaku](Team_Roppyaku) of the Guild met with [Team Profundo](Team_Profundo) to stop [Zoroark the Unkillable](Zoroark_the_Unkillable) from entering the [Infernal Machine](Infernal_Machine_(Tale)). This event causes [Larvesta](Volcarona_(Team_Roppyaku)), [Arctibax](Guildmaster_Baxcalibur), [Zweilous](Hydreigon_(Team_Roppyaku)) and [Zweilous](Hydreigon_(Team_Profundo)) to evolve.

It is unknown what exactly happened, but the team formed by [Drizzile](Drizzile_(Glaive_Expedition_Federation)) loses two of its members in 6768 ISC (7 years ago).

During 6775 ISC's Dura Town Festival, Litleo is Pokénapped, and Dusknoir intervenes when [Regigigas](Regigigas) causes devastation.

[Ralmin](Ralmin_the_Bergmite) ingests tainted [Herba Mystica](Herba_Mystica), but survives due to [Pom](Pom_the_Honedge)'s intervention. The Guild members visiting Archa City are all summoned into the [Temple of the Serpent and King](Archa_City) to face [Miraidon](Miraidon_(Myth)). They inform Ralmin and Pom that though Ralmin was fated to die that day, Pom has defied fate, and Miraidon congratulates the two on forging their own destiny. 

A Sableye attempts to break into the Guild. 

[Team_Orchard](Team_Orchard) finds the tomb of the [Sailor King](Sailor_King).

[Team Stamp Squad](Team_Stamp_Squad) finds a [Tera Seed](Tera_Crystal) and plants it in Dura Town. Shortly after, Terastalized Pokémon appear in the Mystery Dungeons near Dura Town!

Team Orchard recruits [Ostana the Hattrem](Ostana_(Ostana%27s_Opus)) as an Alchemist for Dura Town.

Team Stamp Squad obtains a [Cryptographic Key](Cryptographic_Key) for the Guild from Mount Maw.

[Team_Nova](Team_Nova) of the Guild corrects the timeline and returns [Carew_City](Carew_City) into existence.

Team Nova also finds one of the reliquaries holding a piece of the [Queen of Shattered Crystal](Queen_of_Shattered_Crystal)'s corpse.
