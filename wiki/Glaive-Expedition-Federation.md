## History

Originally based on [Guranbar Island](Guranbar-Island), the Guild encountered a setback when a [Flame Wing](Moltres-(Myth)) cultist attempted to revive his deity. Fortunately, only one mon was fatally wounded; the same cultist that spurred the event.

In 6758 ISC (17 years ago), the Guild relocated to [Dura Town](Dura-Town) and heavily invested in the infrastructure of the town. It remains in this location since.

[Team Roppyaku](Team-Roppyaku) of the Guild met with [Team Profundo](Team-Profundo) to stop [Zoroark the Unkillable](Zoroark-the-Unkillable) from entering the [Infernal Machine](Infernal-Machine-(Tale)). This event causes [Larvesta](Volcarona-(Team-Roppyaku)), [Arctibax](Guildmaster-Baxcalibur), [Zweilous](Hydreigon-(Team-Roppyaku)) and [Zweilous](Hydreigon-(Team-Profundo)) to evolve.

It is unknown what exactly happened, but the team formed by [Drizzile](Drizzile-(Glaive-Expedition-Federation)) loses two of its members in 6768 ISC (7 years ago).

During 6775 ISC's Dura Town Festival, Litleo is Pokénapped, and Dusknoir intervenes when [Regigigas](Regigigas) causes devastation.

[Ralmin](Ralmin-the-Bergmite) ingests tainted [Herba Mystica](Herba-Mystica), but survives due to [Pom](Pom-the-Honedge)'s intervention. The Guild members visiting Archa City are all summoned into the [Temple of the Serpent and King](Archa-City) to face [Miraidon](Miraidon-(Myth)). They inform Ralmin and Pom that though Ralmin was fated to die that day, Pom has defied fate, and Miraidon congratulates the two on forging their own destiny. 

A Sableye attempts to break into the Guild. 

[Team Orchard](Team-Orchard) finds the tomb of the [Sailor King](Sailor-King).

[Team Stamp Squad](Team-Stamp-Squad) finds a [Tera Seed](Tera-Crystal) and plants it in Dura Town. Shortly after, Terastalized Pokémon appear in the Mystery Dungeons near Dura Town!

Team Orchard recruits [Ostana the Hattrem](Ostana-(Ostana%27s-Opus)) as an Alchemist for Dura Town.

Team Stamp Squad obtains a [Cryptographic Key](Cryptographic-Key) for the Guild from Mount Maw.

[Team Nova](Team-Nova) of the Guild corrects the timeline and returns [Carew City](Carew-City) into existence.

Team Nova also finds one of the reliquaries holding a piece of the [Queen of Shattered Crystal](Queen-of-Shattered-Crystal)'s corpse.
