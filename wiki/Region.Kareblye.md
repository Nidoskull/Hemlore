# Kareblye
**Kareblye** is a region extremely close to [Krysivgo](Region.Krysivgo) composed mainly of a temperate climate and dotted with forests and grasslands. To its west lies a large mountain that blocks easy passage between Kareblye and Krysivgo for terrestrial Pokémon.

## Customs
Kareblyan youth are often encouraged to go out into the world once they reach their species's age of maturity, to gain friends and conquer foes. A group of competitively-brained Pokémon have built an arena near the foot of [Mount Silvern't](Loc.NotMtSilver) as a final challenge on this journey.

## Capital/Largest City

Masakuri holds the ceremonial capital title.

## History and Myths
Thanks to its proximity to Krysivgo, Kareblyan mythology has over time mixed with Krysivgoan myths. The [Lord of the Silver Wing](Tale.Lugia) is often considered to be 'in charge' of the three legendary avians, and it can sometimes be seen off the coast of [Guranbar Island](Loc.Guranbar%20Island).

Many Pokémon in Kareblye firmly believe in the [Firstborn Heir](Tale.Mew), alongside smaller groups dedicated to the [Flame](Tale.Moltres), [Freeze](Tale.Articuno) and [Bolt](Tale.Zapdos) Wings. Notably, Kareblyan worship of the Elemental Wings believes them to be benevolent, in contrast to the [Galtunaric](Region.Galtunar) beliefs.
