As Steenee leads the team to the dungeon,  the sounds and sights of a warm meadow surround them. When they look around, they see Combee buzzing about, Skiddo galloping happily, and Bellsprout wriggling in the sun.

The team faces a [Tera](Terastalization)-Electric cottonee. Neon activates their [Shiny Surge](Mech.Shiny%20Surge) to temporarily learn a move that does more damage and learns Waterfall. Hemlock eats a [Gummi](Item.Gummi) but learns they don't work as well in dungeons.

[Monster House](Mech.Mystery%20Dungeon). Hemlock gets eelslapped by Neon trying to waste an orb while in tears. Neon almost gets killed but holds on with a shimmer using their second Shiny Surge, then gets an Oran Berry thrown at by Hemlock.

On the next floor we find an hollowed-out trees with claw marks on it. And our client [Kricketot](Species.Kricketot)! We continue in the dungeon to find what's up with the tree, and find a trampled bush. According to Hemlock, it was done by a [Shieldon](Species.Shieldon) or [Bastiodon](Species.Shieldon), even though they don't appear in this area. Later we come across a weird colored flower, wich seems to be a [Volcarona](Species.Larvesta)'s doing.

Monster House... Or it was. All 7-9 Pokémon are already defeated when we enter the room. One of the [Spearow](Species.Spearow) looks to have been hit by Wild Charge judging by the pollen around. Probably [Volcarona](Species.Larvesta) pollen.

The rest of the dungeon is empty. We then find a massive clearing with piles of loot and a large Pokemon in the midde giving orders. It's a [Slither Wing](Char.Slither%20Wing%20(Criminal)) with a murder of [Murkrow](Species.Murkrow) around it. The team hides in the nearby bushes, but Hemlock steps on a branch. The Slither Wing commands to seize us and we warp away with an [Escape Orb](Item.Orb).
