Missions: Item retrieval - Spoink's orb

---
As the sun rains down on our trio of intrepid heroes, the faint sound of buzzing Combee and galloping Skiddo disrupts the silence of the Sunlit Meadows.

The team finds a ghost box (<- proper name later) then Neon gets in a fight alone until the others come to help. Neon almost dies to a single Bellsprout.

On the 3rd floor the terrain becomes grassy, then we find a strange rock with something possibly inside; and even laterer we find Spoink's orb

Monster house. Hemlock gets KO'd and then not and then escapes the floor while Neon and Gambit stay and fight the remaining pokemons.

On the last floor of the dungeon we find a Ditto that rewards us with a move from a line's parent. Gambit takes up Sucker Punch.

We finish the dungeon and warp to the guild.
