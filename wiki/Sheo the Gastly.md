## Description
**Sheo** the **[Gastly](Gastly)** is a ally explorer as part of [Team Nova](Team%20Nova). She came to the guild after [Nova mission #4] , She is 12 years old and hails from an unknown place. 

They are a slightly lighter colour than other Gastly, and are non-verbal, instead communicating through body language and non-language sounds. She often possesses items, such as Team Nova's bag.


## Relationships

Sheo has no known relatives, but may be related to the [Team Meanie's Gengar](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Gengar_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#In_the_spin-off_games), as [Team Meanie](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Team_Meanies)'s Arbok is the one informing Guildmaster Baxcalibur about her. She may potentially be related to  [Jeff the Gengar](Jeff%20the%20Gengar) & [Esnorb the Metagross](Legate%20Esnorb).



As a member of Team Nova, Sheo is friends with [Hemlock the Venipede](Hemlock%20the%20Venipede), [Gambit the Pawniard](Gambit%20the%20Pawniard), [Neon the Tynamo](Neon%20the%20Tynamo), and [Aemilia the Rookiedee](Aemilia%20the%20Rookidee).

Additionally, she knows [Vulcan the Charizard](Vulcan%20the%20Charizard), and an unknown Pokemon is after her

## History
Very little is known about Sheo's past, and I'm a little hesitant to pry. [Guildmaster Baxcalibur](Guildmaster%20Baxcalibur) has shared with us that she was involved in a chain breeding experiment to try and create a perfectly bred Pokémon. They have been placed at the Guild to protect them, being assigned to Team Nova as a cover story; Team Nova had just returned from a mission, and generally, their dorm is considered the calmest.
