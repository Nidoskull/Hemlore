## Description
**Kasparov** the **[Bisharp](Species.Pawniard)** is [Gambit](Char.Gambit%20the%20Pawniard)'s father, living somewhere in [Isshu](Region.Isshu).

We have not properly met him, but Gambit notes he can be rather self-absorbed at times. He has one Leader's Crest, attached at his wrist, and wears a tattered brown cape.

He speaks, at minimum, [Isshun](Region.Isshu).

## Relationships
Known relatives are:
- [Judit](Char.Judit%20the%20Kingambit) (Ex-Wife)
- [Gambit](Char.Gambit%20the%20Pawniard) (Son)
- [Hikaru](Char.Hikaru%20the%20Gambit) (Daughter)

One member of his squadron is [Deep Blue](Char.Deep%20Blue%20the%20Pawniard).

## History
According to Gambit: 
He was a powerful and respected Leader's Crest Bisharp within his army, though known for being rather rude and selfish. He got with Judit, another Leader's Crest Bisharp at the time. This resulted in two children.

Shortly after Hikaru hatched, Kasparov and Judit got into a fight, causing the two to split. They worked together as part of the army, but openly disliked each other. After the passing of the previous Kingambit leader, Kasparov was desperate to become the new leader. Kasparov obtained two Leader's Crests, but before he could get his third, Judit obtained hers and evolved into a Kingambit - becoming the new leader. 

Kasparov got *so* mad about seeing his ex become the new leader, he refused to take her orders, broke rank, and left the army with his children and those in his brigade who would follow him. He joined a much smaller army, but remains disconnected from them as they don't trust him due to him breaking rank before.
