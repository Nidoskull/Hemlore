`Paste icon here`
## Description
**Matidia** the **[Eevee](Species.Eevee)** was the Basilinna of [Carew City](City.Carew%20City) of 6000 years ago. She uses she/her pronouns.

She speaks (old) [Satojiran](Region.Satojiri).

## Relationships
Known relatives are:
- Basilinna (Name Unknown) (Mother, Leafeon)

She was known to trust her [Mestor](Char.Mestor%20Wormwood) and her [Strategos](Char.Strategos%20Brutus).

## History
When she was but a Sebaste, a small kit, her mother, the previous Basilinna, became ill. Nowadays, it is unclear whether she died naturally, or if [False Basileus Fictusilva](Char.Fictusilva) shortened her life for power. As Matidia was still too young, too small to rule, the title of Basileus went to Fictusilva instead.

Apparently, despite Matidia's youth, Fictusilva still deemed her a threat to his rule. Instead of caring for the young kit, Fictusilva let her die, alone, with only her mother's shorn leaves as companions.

Fortunately, the story does not end there. Thanks to a plan hatched by [Mestor Wormwood](Mestor%20Wormwood), and aided by a time-displaced [Team Nova](Team.Nova), [Ladon](Char.Ladon%20the%20Dipplin) and [Néon](Char.Neon%20the%20Eelektrik) used their Shiny Surges together. The cold body shivered, returned to life, and the alive-again Matidia stormed *her* palace and regained *her* throne.

She declared that as long as she was known and remembered, those who aided her when the need was greatest would never need to bow to anyone in Carew City.

At present, I sadly don't know how her tale ends; however, six-thousand years from her time, [one of her descendants](Char.Basilinna%20Matidia%20II) was named after her.
