## Shiny Surge

Shiny Surge is a special ability specific to [Shiny](Mech.Shiny) Pokemon, granted by [Victini](Tale.Victini), allowing them to do a special action during a battle in dungeon.

These actions can vary from getting a super-effective move in a pinch, to surviving a KO; and can be used in tandem with another's shiny surge for a much greater effect. If used to avoid fainting, the user only gets half the xp after battle.

## Notable uses

- [Char.Neon the Tynamo](Char.Neon%20the%20Tynamo) and [Ladon the Dipplin](Ladon%20the%20Dipplin) combined their power to bring Basilinna Matidia to life during [Nova Mission #3](Report.Nova3)
