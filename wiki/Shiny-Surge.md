## Shiny Surge

Shiny Surge is a special ability specific to Shiny Pokemon, granted by [Victini](Victini-(Myth)), allowing them to do a special action during a battle in dungeon.

These actions can vary from temporarily learning a super-effective move in a pinch, to surviving a KO; and can be used in tandem with another's shiny surge for a much greater effect. If used to avoid fainting, the user only gets half the xp after battle.

## Notable uses

- [Neon the Tynamo](Neon-the-Tynamo) and [Ladon the Dipplin](Ladon-the-Dipplin) combined their power to bring Basilinna Matidia to life during [Nova Mission #3](Report.NovaMission-3)
