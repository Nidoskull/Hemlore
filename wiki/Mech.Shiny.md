## Shiny Pokémon

Shiny-ness is a condition some Pokemons are born with. Granted by [Victini](Char.Victini), these pokemons bare a different color and extreme luck as well as a special power unique to them. If not careful, these pokemons can have their colors taken from them wich cuts their link with Victini entirely.

## Shiny Surge

Shiny Surge is a special ability specific to Shiny Pokemon, granted by Victini, allowing them to do a special action during a battle in dungeon.

These actions can vary from getting a super-effective move in a pinch, to surviving a KO; and can be used in tandem with another’s shiny surge for a much greater effect. If used to avoid fainting, the user only gets half the xp after battle.

## Colorless Pokémons

These Pokemons have had their colors taken away from them by High Magistrate Zygarde or Giratina. Reverting those Pokemon to the time without colour and individuality. This can happen if a pokemon selfishly steals for themself or desecrate shrines.

This can also happen to normal pokemons, but is less noticeable as they can be mistaken for being leucistic.
