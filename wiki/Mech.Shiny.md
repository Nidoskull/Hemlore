## Shiny Pokémon

Shiny-ness is a condition some Pokemons are born with. Granted by [Victini](Tale.Victini), these pokemons bare a different color and extreme luck as well as a special power unique to them. If not careful, these pokemons can have their colors taken from them wich cuts their link with Victini entirely.

## History

_from direct account of Relicanth:_ "I remember the first Shiny Pokemon... I was just a little girl when the star fell from the sky. Killed off, well most everything on the planet. Most Fossil Pokemon only exist today because Koraidon saved 'em. See, in that star was a Pokemon that blazed with light. She was real pretty that one, I forgive her for killing my Anorith because it wasn't her fault.

See, a Relicanth and an Anorith, we aren't exactly compatible species. Me and my lovely Anorith, he and I couldn't have a kid of our own. But the Pokemon from the stars, she gave us something that chance could never give us. A special little someone. And my baby, she had her daddy's eyes but not his colour. No, she was something special. Something unique. Not like other Anorith. She was a little more like me, but not the same. What mattered was she was a different colour than every other Anorith. Victini made my daughter something special.

Now it's said any time that a Pokemon is born when the star that Victini used to be part of twinkles just right, they'll be Shiny just like my daughter. To show the world that Victini remembers what happened when she came here."

Also apparently Zygarde can become temporarily Shiny if absorbing a shiny pokemon.

## Shiny Surge

Shiny Surge is a special ability specific to Shiny Pokemon, granted by Victini, allowing them to do a special action during a battle in dungeon.

These actions can vary from getting a super-effective move in a pinch, to surviving a KO; and can be used in tandem with another’s shiny surge for a much greater effect. If used to avoid fainting, the user only gets half the xp after battle.

## Colorless Pokémons

These Pokemons have had their colors taken away from them by High Magistrate Zygarde or Giratina. Reverting those Pokemon to the time without colour and individuality. This can happen if a pokemon selfishly steals for themself or desecrate shrines.

This can also happen to normal pokemons, but is less noticeable as they can be mistaken for being leucistic.
