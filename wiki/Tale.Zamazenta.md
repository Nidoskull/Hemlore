*The above image is an artist's impression based on several descriptions, and may not be accurate to Zamazenta's true appearance.*
## Description
**Zamazenta** is a Legendary Pokémon. Due to this, little is known about him in current day. Zamazenta uses he/him pronouns as far as we're aware.

Zamazenta is described as a red-furred, bulky canine with deep battle scars. He has a blue ponytail on his head, similar to a knight's plume. His tail is colored the same blue. He has a thick-furred mane, almost resembling a shield.

Strangely, Zamazenta has *also* been described as a gold-and-red canine, with no scars or anything of the kind. Protected by a golden shield, he can shrug off any attack.

Zamzday is named after Zamazenta.
## Relationships
It is believed that Zamazenta has a sister in [Zacian](Tale.Zacian), though other sources describe the pair as unrelated rivals.

Presumably, he and Eternatus are chill now.
## History
Very little is known about Zamazenta's past before the incident of the Great Devouring, and also after that. 

During the Great Devouring, however, records state Zamazenta and Zacian banded together to help defeat Eternatus.

The Glaive Expedition Federation encountered Zamazenta during [Joint Expedition 4](Report.Joint%20Expedition%204)!
