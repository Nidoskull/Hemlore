# Nlipede (Venipede/Whirlipede/Scolipede species family)
Nlipedes are Bug/Poison type centipede-like Pokémon, with a highly segmented body. Generally, their carapace is reddish-pink, with eye-like markings across segments. A nlipede's age can be estimated based on the amount of segments their body has, as they gain a segment every two to three molts. (Estimating someone's age is still often seen as rude.) A group of nlipedes is called a swarm. 

Venipede have two large quills attached to their head which double as antennae. Though their carapace is tough, they are generally quite weak nonetheless. Venipede are often seen as easily annoyed and lack thinking ahead, and some may even turn violent quickly, but this isn't true of all Venipede! Venipede [evolves](Evolution) into Whirlipede at level 22.

Whirlipede are the second stage of evolution, and are almost always seen in a rolled-up state. This is not to say they *can't* unroll themselves, but they rarely have reason to. Its darkened, purple carapace has hardened significantly, and it uses this newfound durability to roll without a care in the world. The top speed measured in Whirlipede is over 100 km/h, though averages sit much lower at around 60 km/h. Whirlipede evolves into Scolipede at level 30.

Scolipede are the final stage of evolution. This Pokémon is almost equine in build, with four legs used for locomotion, and the rest of its legs being used mostly for grabbing. Scolipede are characteristically determined, and may at times be considered single-minded. ~~The entire species has hyperfocus issues.~~ Scolipede are capable of Mega Evolving into Mega Scolipede.

Mega Scolipede has channeled its fervent wishes into more potent poisons. Alongside paralysis in non-nlipedes, Mega Scolipede poison causes hallucinations and numbing. Mega Scolipede is not immune to these new toxins, and may suddenly lash out due to these hallucinations. There is a known black market on Mega Scolipede-created recreational drugs, and seized drugs have been known to be contaminated with Mega Scolipede toxins to heighten their effects.

The toxins of the nlipede family act as a paralyzing agent, causing damage by stopping vital functions in high doses. These toxins  have been used in medical contexts for ages, as part of anaesthetic procedures and to control out-of-control muscles. Caution must still be used, however, as administering these poisons may paralyse the breathing muscles, requiring additional aid.

Nlipede eggs are small and partially translucent. The majority of eggs laid by nlipedes are not fertilized, instead functioning as a food source for the one or two fertilized eggs in the clutch, alongside protection against dehydration and (a remnant of) predation. Nlipedes are notably very protective of their egg clutches; if one invites you to come look, it means they trust you very much.
