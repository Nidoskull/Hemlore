## Description
**[Machoke](Species.Machop)** is the [Glaive Expedition Federation](Guild.Glaive)'s trainer, in charge of keeping us all in shape and not hurt from said training. She has also been known as Machop, and uses she/her pronouns.

Machoke is heavily tattood with motifs taken from the Swords of Justice ([Virizion](Tale.Virizion), [Terrakion](Tale.Terrakion) and [Cobalion](Tale.Cobalion)) and [Zamazenta](Tale.Zamazenta). She has been described repeatedly as a 'butch princess' (whatever that means). She has been training to master a Forbidden Technique; No Guard Fissure. For some reason, it just doesn't work...

She speaks, at minimum, [Satojiran](Region.Satojiri), and likely speaks [Galtunaric](Region.Galtunar) as well.

## Relationships
Machoke has been a member of the Glaive Expedition Federation for a long time, and trusts the rest of the Guild with her life. And forces the rest to also trust theirs with her with the shenanigans she gets up to.
