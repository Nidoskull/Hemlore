# Kitsune (Vulpix & Ninetales species family)
Vulpix and Ninetales are a strange species of Pokémon that comes in two varieties. One, generally considered the [Kareblyan](Region.Kareblye) variant, is a Fire-type, and usually has a temper to match. Another variety, generally called the [Alo'lolan](Region.Alo%27lola) variant, is an Ice type, and as such prefers the snow. Upon evolution, Alo'lolan Ninetales become Ice/Fairy types.

Whether Kareblyan or Alo'lolan, Vulpix and Ninetales are vulpine Pokémon, quadrupedal with many tails.

Kareblyan Vulpix's fur is reddish-orange, with brown 'socks' on its paws and a cream belly. Its eyes are gray-brown, and have no visible sclera. It has a small, bright orange mane, and up to eight tails of the same color. A young Vulpix will have just one white tail, which will split into multiple as it ages. Kareblyan Vulpix [evolve](Mech.Evolution) into Ninetales through use of a [Fire Stone](Item.Evolution%20Stone).

Kareblyan Ninetales have cream fur, aside from their tail tips, which are orange. Its eyes are bright red, and have no visible sclera. It has long, glossy fur, especially on its head and chest. Most notably, Ninetales have nine tails, as their name might imply. Ninetales tails are highly sensitive, and generally, Ninetales do not like their tails being touched, especially by strangers. A common children's tale is that if you touch a Ninetales's tail, you will be cursed for a thousand years. Kareblyan Ninetales are often seen as smart, but also highly vengeful.

Alo'lolan Vulpix, to contrast, are almost entirely a snowy white. Their 'socks' are a blue-ish white, and the inside of their ears is dark blue. Their eyes are a bright blue. Compared to Kareblyan Vulpix, Alo'lolan Vulpix have a smaller build, with a proportionally slightly larger head. Their mane and tails appear to be composed of snow at a glance, but are just extremely fluffy. Alo'lolan Vulpix evolve into Ninetales by using an [Ice Stone](Item.Evolution%20Stone).

Alo'lolan Ninetales are quiet and reserved. They possess two layers of fur; a blue undercoat which keeps them warm, and a white guard coat for protection. This leads to a mostly-white coloration at a distance, which turns blue upon closer inspection. Alo'lolan Ninetales fur is incredibly downy and light, adapted to life in high mountain ranges and other incredibly cold areas. 

_This is where I would put its move learnset... but I don't know it :(_
